<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The February Man: Evolving Consciousness and Identity in Hypnotherapy</h2><p>From the front flap: &#34;This volume is a rare record of Milton H. Erickson&#39;s pioneering genius in facilitating the evolution of new patterns of consciousness and identity in a young woman. It is the only completely documented report of an entire hypnotherapeutic case from the middle phase of Erickson&#39;s career, when his innovative approaches were being developed. [It] brilliantly illustrates the actual words and methods used by Erickson that are currently transforming the meaning and essence of the entire field of psychotherapy. Therapists of all persuasions will appreciate the detailed commentaries offered by Erickson himself on the whys, ways, and means of his naturalistic and permissive approaches to healing. &#39;The February Man&#39; is a fascinating case study which illustrates the use of multiple levels of consciousness and meaning to access and therapeutically reframe traumatic memories that were the source of very severe phobias and depression. Erickson&#39;s masterful use of minimal cues and indirect suggestion enable him to assume the supportive role of the &#39;February Man&#39; who &#39;visits&#39; the patient many times during profound states of age regression. During these sessions Erickson evokes and utilizes many classical hypnotic phenomena (such as automatic writing, time distortion, and amnesia) to facilitate that &#39;reassociation and resynthesis&#39; of the inner life which he regards as the essence of cure. As the February Man, he provides the patient with the seeds for new developments in her adult personality and with a more complete view of herself and the world in transition. &#39;The February Man&#39; makes available for the first time the complete, verbatim transcripts and commentaries of a life in transformation that is a Rosetta stone for understanding &#39;the new hypnosis&#39;. This intimate portrait will be treasured by all who seek to grow along with one of the most humane therapists of our time.&#34;</p><p>Has done more than any other individual this century to change the way in which hypnotherapy is practiced. He was a fellow of many international professional bodies as was the founding president of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. <br> <br>Ernest L. Rossi, Ph.D., is Diplomate in Clinical Psychology and the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Psychotherapy by the Milton H. Erickson Foundation. He is also the science editor of Psychological Perspectives and the author, coauthor, and editor of numerous professional books.<p><em>"It was with considerable excitement that I realized that...this volume has been recently reissued. The value of</em> The February Man <em>is that it consists of the transcript of an entire course of hypnotherapy, conducted by Erickson in 1945, long before he became known to the therapeutic community at large.</em> <em>This is a decided advantage for the reader, permitting careful examination of what Erickson actually said and did with this particular client. In structuring the repeating episodes of hypnotic age regression in the transcript of [this book], Erickson tells the client, 'You are going to see me...again and again.' With any luck, the same will be true for current and future generations of therapists through continued access to his writings."</em> <strong>-Steven N. Gold in PsycCRITIQUES December 2009, Vol.54</strong></p></p><h2>Ghosts on the Roof: Selected Journalism of Whittaker Chambers, 1931-1959</h2><p>This collection of Whittaker Chamber&#39;s journalism is a superb rediscovery of the artistry of a great figure. --William F. Buckley, Jr.</p><p><p> <em>Terry Teachout</em> is a member of the editorial board of the New York <i>Daily News</i>. His writing appears in <i>The American Scholar, Commentary, High Fidelity, Musical America, National Review, The New Criterion, The New Dance Review, and The Wall Street Journal.</i></p><p> "[<i>Ghosts on the Roof</i>] is an important contribution to history and to literature. It will do . . . much to restore the correct perspective. . . . A superb rediscovery of the artistry of a great figure."</p> <p> &#x2014;William F. Buckley, Jr. "The world knows Whittaker Chambers best as a philosopher and a hero of liberty. Because of <i>Ghosts on the Roof</i>, it will be reminded that he was also a first-rank critic, an incisive stylist, and all in all one of America's greatest journalists. Terry Teachout's valuable collection will go directly to my most easily reached bookshelf, right next to the well-worn copies of <i>Witness and Cold Friday</i>."</p> <p> &#x2014;Richard Nixon "<i>Ghosts on the Roof</i> is an important book. . . . Chambers writes with distinction, compassion, and authority."</p> <p> &#x2014;Hilton Kramer "This book is a treasure chest for admirers of Whittaker Chambers such as myself."</p> <p> &#x2014;Robert Novak &nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, Vol. 2: The Spirit of Eastern Christendom (600-1700)</h2><p><br>The line that separated Eastern Christendom from Western on the medieval map is similar to the "iron curtain" of recent times. Linguistic barriers, political divisions, and liturgical differences combined to isolate the two cultures from each other. Except for such episodes as the schism between East and West or the Crusades, the development of non-Western Christendom has been largely ignored by church historians. In <i>The Spirit of Eastern Christendom</i>, Jaroslav Pelikan explains the divisions between Eastern and Western Christendom, and identifies and describes the development of the distinctive forms taken by Christian doctrine in its Greek, Syriac, and early Slavic expression.<br><br>"It is a pleasure to salute this masterpiece of exposition. . . . The book flows like a great river, slipping easily past landscapes of the utmost diversity&#x2014;the great Christological controversies of the seventh century, the debate on icons in the eighth and ninth, attitudes to Jews, to Muslims, to the dualistic heresies of the high Middle Ages, to the post-Reformation churches of Western Europe. . . . His book succeeds in being a study of the Eastern Christian religion as a whole."&#x2014;Peter Brown and Sabine MacCormack, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The second volume of Professor Pelikan's monumental work on The Christian Tradition is the most comprehensive historical treatment of Eastern Christian thought from 600 to 1700, written in recent years. . . . Pelikan's reinterpretation is a major scholarly and ecumenical event."&#x2014;John Meyendorff<br><br>"Displays the same mastery of ancient and modern theological literature, the same penetrating analytical clarity and balanced presentation of conflicting contentions, that made its predecessor such an intellectual treat."&#x2014;<i>Virgina Quarterly Review<br><br></i><br></p><p><br><b>Jaroslav Pelikan</b> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University.<br></p><h2>Baking &amp; Pastry: Mastering the Art and Craft</h2><p>The Culinary Institute of America holds nothing back in its mission to provide students, professionals, and enthusiasts with everything they need to know about the baking and pastry industry.

Yet, dissatisfied and lonely, he&#x2019;s begun to question the conformity, consumerism, and competitiveness of his conservative, and ultimately cultureless middle-class community. His despairing sense that something, many things are missing from his life leads him into a flirtation with liberal politics and a fling with an attractive and seemingly &#x201c;bohemian&#x201d; widow. But he soon finds that his attempts at rebellion may cost more than he is willing to pay.&nbsp;&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RThe title of &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RSinclair Lewis&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&#x2019;s 1922 satire on American materialism added a new word to our vocabulary. &#x201c;Babbittry&#x201d; has come to stand for all that&#x2019;s wrong with a world where the pursuit of happiness means the procurement of things&#x2015;a world that substitutes &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; for &#x201c;soul.&#x201d; Some twenty years after &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBabbitt&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&#x2019;s initial success, critics called Lewis dated and his fiction old-fashioned. But these judgments have come to seem like wishful thinking.

Babbitt, a conniving, prosperous real estate man from Zenith, Ohio, revels in his popularity, his success, and, especially, in the material rewards they bring. He bullies his wife, flirts with other women, and patronizes the less successful. But when his best friend is sent to prison for killing his wife, Babbitt&#39;s middle-class complacency is shattered, and he rebels, seeking a more &#34;meaningful&#34; life. His small revolt is quickly defeated, however, by public opinion and his own need for acceptance. Babbitt captures the flavor of America during the economic boom years of the 1920s, and its protagonist has become the symbol of middle-class mediocrity, his name an enduring part of the American lexicon.</p><h2>Short Guide to Writing About Literature Second Canadian Edition (2nd Edition)</h2><p><b> <p>Designed for English literature survey courses at the university level.</p> </b> <p>A Short Guide to Writing About Literature, provides useful guidance and a comprehensive introduction to writing about stories, plays, poems, essays, and films from a Canadian perspective, using Canadian examples.</p></p><p>Preface <p> Favorable response to the sixth edition has allowed me to revise the book again. Many changes have been made throughout, but the most obvious are: </p><p> The increased amount of writing by students&#x2014; annotations, preliminary notes, entries in journals, drafts, and complete essays Amplified checklists with questions that writers can ask themselves in order to generate ideas for essays Amplified discussions of current critical approaches, for example, Gender (Feminist, Gay and Lesbian) Criticism, Myth Criticism, New Historicism Chapters on What Is Literature?, What Is Interpretation?, and What Is Evaluation? Bibliographic suggestions concerning criticism and interpretation Suggestions about writing with a word processor </p><p> Part One (four chapters emphasizing the close connection between reading and writing) assumes that we can't write well unless we can read well. If nothing else, we must be able to read our own prose thoughtfully. Reading, after all, is a way of getting ideas for writing. These early chapters emphasize the importance in the writing process of such activities as annotating a text, brainstorming, keeping a journal, and (especially) asking oneself questions in order to generate ideas. (Oddly, these activities are often called "pre-writing," but in fact they are part of the process of writing.) Explication and analysis are discussed and illustrated with examples. </p><p> Part Two, on thinking critically about literature, is almost entirely new to the book. It looks at some definitions of literature, considers the relationships among interpretation, meaning, and evaluation, and then offers a survey of some of the chief critical approaches. </p><p> Part Three, on writing about essays, fiction, poetry, drama, and film, introduces the reader to the elements of each genre, but looks back to Part One and provides some drafts and essays by students on representative works. In accordance with the assumption in Part One that asking questions is an invaluable way of getting ideas, each chapter on writing about a genre concludes with a checklist of questions that readers may ask themselves as they read, reread, and think about a work. </p><p> Part Four contains three chapters. The first of these, "Style and Format," is a fairly short and direct approach to the elements of clear writing. It treats such matters as denotation, connotation, subordination, paragraphing, and so forth. The latter part of the chapter, devoted to manuscript form, is concerned chiefly with mechanical matters, ranging from the form of the title of an essay to advice on how to introduce quotations. The second chapter in this section, "Writing a Research Paper," includes material on discovering a topic and thesis, on finding material (not only through printed bibliographic guides but also through materials on line and on disc), on using a word processor in writing a research paper, and on the MLA system of documentation. The third chapter briefly discusses essay examinations. </p><p> Three appendixes conclude the book: The first includes two stories ("Araby' and "The Lottery") that are the subjects of student essays, the second provides a glossary of literary terms, and the third offers a checklist for writing with a word processor. </p><p> I hope that the preceding remarks adequately describe the scope of the book, but some further words must be added. Dr. Johnson said, </p><p> There is not so poor a book in the world that would not be a prodigious effort were it wrought out entirely by a single mind, without the air of previous investigators. </p><p> I cannot name all of the previous investigators who have helped shape my ideas about literature, about writing about literature, and about teaching writing, but I must acknowledge my indebtedness to Morton Berman, William Burto, and Marcia Stubbs, who never tire of improving my pages, to Lee Edelman, who contributed part of the discussion of gay and lesbian criticism, and (at HarperCollins) to Robert Ginsberg, Judith Leet, and Lisa Moore. Others, who offered valuable help when I revised earlier editions, include Rebecca Argall, James Blake, Randall Brune, David Cavitch, Warren Chelline, Charles Christensen, William Evans, Shearle Furnish, Bruce Golden, Okey Goode, Patricia Graves, Dean Hall, James Heldman, Deena Linnett, William T Liston, Janet Madden, Gratia Murphy, J. M. Pair, Diane Quantic, Virginia Shale, Isabel Bonnyman Stanley, and Tom Zaniello. </p><p> When I thought that the manuscript for this edition was in satisfactory shape, the publisher sent it to the following reviewers, all of whom offered valuable suggestions that I have now incorporated into the text: Ann Andrews, Mississippi State University; Robert Evans, Auburn University at Montgomery; Sarah Favors, South Carolina State University; Anita Obermeier, Arizona State University; Judy Stokes, Southside Virginia Community College; Juanita Smart, Washington State University; Christopher Thaiss, George Mason University; and Susan Wing, University of Nebraska Lincoln. One other reader of the manuscript must be singled out for special mention, William Cain of Wellesley College, once my student and now my teacher. His abundant and penetrating annotations of the manuscript have amply repaid me for whatever annotations I put, years ago, on his undergraduate essays. </p><p> SYLVAN BARNET</p><p> New features of this edition include: chapters on critical approaches and evaluation of literature expanded checklists for writing and reading a new sample research paper the most current MLA guidelines</p></p><h2>Ikebana: Asian Arts and Crafts for Creative Kids</h2><p>This is the fourth book in the <i>Asian Arts and Crafts for Creative Kids</i> series, and introduces kids to the fascinating art of Japanese flower arranging.

Some twenty people have come together at the home of David Myers, the WorldCom Controller. The atmosphere is full of good-hearted banter, but an unseen cloud hangs over this seemingly perfect picture. Within two years, almost every employee present will be gone from the company. Three will be indicted for fraud, and I will be thrust into the center of a storm.</p> <p>Why are the subpoenas locked in another room? Do I really want to go to New York and sit down with someone who's being hostile and patronizing?? If I don't, will the U.S. Marshals really come to my house tonight and take me into custody? I've received no clear answers, but I refuse to take any chances.</p> <p>The guard unlocks the doors, and we file in. Brown cardboard boxes are everywhere, each labeled with the name of a former WorldCom executive. It feels like we're trespassing. I read the names of people I used to work with as we slowly walk through, as if in a graveyard, reading the dates of life and death on the headstones. I think of retirements, camaraderie, years of hard work by thousands&#x2014;lost. What was once an inspiration has vanished into the ether.</p> <p>This is a story about people and choices. It shows how power and money can change people, and how easy it is to rationalize, give in to fear, and cave under pressure and intimidation from superiors. We can't protect our children from adversity or even predict the challenges they'll face. But we can prepare them for how to respond. As I share the story with students, I talk about character, choices, and courage. In the end, life is about choices. Our challenge is to choose well.</p></p><h2>Infants and Children: Prenatal Through Middle Childhood</h2><p>Normal wear and tear from moderate use.

This well-conceived, thoughtfully annotated anthology both documents and honors that process of creating identities, histories, and cultural memories in the aftermath of diaspora.<p> Marable and Mullings's collection takes in examples of African American social and political writing over the last three centuries. The anthology's first section, covering the years 1789 to 1865, opens with an excerpt from Nigeria-born Olaudah Equiano's memoir of slavery, which became a key document in the abolitionist movement; the section includes passages from writings and testimonials by Nat Turner, Sojourner Truth, and Frederick Douglass, among others. The second section visits the era of reconstruction and the emergent nationalist and civil rights movements, with contributions from Booker T. Washington, William Monroe Trotter, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others. The third and fourth sections address the relocation of African Americans from predominantly rural settings to the industrial centers of the Northeast and Midwest, a time of revolutionary and artistic ferment, while the fifth section takes readers to the present, guided by the remarks of Cornel West, Jesse Jackson, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and other contemporary thinkers.</p><p> Much of this material is relatively well known, but many pieces have not been gathered elsewhere, making the anthology especially useful to students seeking diverse points of view. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>Manning Marable was professor of history and the founding director of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University.

But it is when Horace undergoes an altogether unforeseeable change of heart that the real difficulties begin. Is the repentant master a victim along with the former slave? And how can anyone endure the memory of the wrongs that have been done?"</p><p>Ivy Compton-Burnett (1892-1969) wrote over fifteen novels about the upper classes of the late Victorian period. The novels are constructed almost entirely of seemingly banal dialogue that eventually reveals, beneath its surface, the truths of human nature and insights into human relationships which Compton-Burnett took as her themes. Her works include&nbsp;<i>Pastors and Masters, A Family and a Fortune, Manservant and Maidservant,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A House and Its Head</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Diane Johnson&#x2019;s most recent novel is&nbsp;<i>Lulu in Marrakech</i>.The realism of this novel [<i>Manservant and Maidservant</i>] like the realism of all Dame Ivy&#x2019;s novels goes far beyond verisimilitude to some psychologically consistent truth that transcends words.<br>&#x2014; Constance Lewis<br><br>A remarkable and unusual novelist, who has, in her own well-tilled field, no rival and no parallel.<br>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br>The thing is, Compton-Burnett is absolutely sui generis, although she&#x2019;s often compared to Jane Austen. But as Francine Prose points out in the afterward to one of these new editions, she is Austen on bad drugs. Compton-Burnett herself was loftily dismissive of a comparison with Henry James. Her remorseless humor and savagery are a unique cocktail. There&#x2019;s no middle ground with this novelist&#x2014;you&#x2019;re either bewildered by her or you become an addict. The technical term for the latter is an Ivyist. I do urge you to find out where you stand.<br>&#x2014; Maria Aitken,&nbsp;<i>Bomb</i></p><h2>The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps</h2><p>Presenting a step-by-step plan for exploring and colonizing space, a practical, coherent, yet visionary blueprint combines cutting-edge science, technological sophistication, and fact-based speculation for building self-contained environments in space, colonizing Mars, and much more. Simultaneous.</p><p>In this boldly optimistic manifesto, Savage proclaims a master plan for the human race: to spread life throughout the galaxy. To many, space exploration seems irrelevant to Earth's real problems; but humanity may in fact have no other way to secure its long-term survival. To remain confined to Earth, Savage claims, is to court extinction, possibly within a few decades. Savage (an engineer who has established the Millennial Foundation to promote space exploration) outlines his program for transferring a significant portion of humanity off-planet. The crucial first step is to colonize the ocean surface with floating cities, quadrupling the living space available to the growing population of Earth. This allows us to reverse the degradation of the environment by shifting to the thermal energy of the deep ocean as our primary power source. At the same time, spirulina algae (already on sale in health food stores) becomes a major new food crop. The hardware for these oceanic colonies is already within practical reach: Savage provides a detailed inventory of how his floating cities would work and support themselves, with copious citations of the scientific literature. Once this move is well underway, it frees up energy and resources for the next steps. Improved space vehicles make possible orbiting space colonies, then settlements on the moon. A larger step is terraforming Mars--creating an atmosphere and a water supply for our lifeless neighbor to form a human habitat. On an even longer time scale, the race can expand into the rest of the solar system: asteroids and the moons of other planets. Ultimately, artificial habitats may completely surround the sun. With the resources of an entire solar system at our command, according to Savage, humanity can at last send out emissaries to other stars. The stuff of science fiction? Of course--but rigorously built from existing science, carefully documented, and convincingly argued. Highly recommended. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It offers fresh, practical ideas for creating a spiritual dialogue with clients, assessing spirituality as a part of their problems and solutions, and helping them draw on spiritual resources in times of stress. Written from a nonsectarian perspective, the book encompasses both traditional and nontraditional forms of spirituality. It is grounded in current findings from psychotherapy research and the psychology of religion, and includes a wealth of evocative case material.<p></p></p><p>K<b>enneth I. Pargament, PhD,</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Psychology at Bowling Green State University, where he has been on the faculty since 1979. He has published extensively on the vital role of religion and spirituality in coping with stress and trauma. Dr. Pargament has been a leading figure in the effort to bring a balanced view of religion and spirituality to the attention of scientists and professionals. He is a recipient of the William James Award for excellence in research in the psychology of religion, the Virginia Staudt Sexton Mentoring Award for guiding and encouraging others in the field, and the Oskar Pfister Award for his research and practice in religion and mental health.&nbsp; Dr. Pargament is a practicing clinical psychologist who has worked with people from diverse spiritual backgrounds. In 2011-2012, he will serve as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the Institute for Spirituality and Health of the Texas Medical Center in Houston.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>"Kudos! In the best tradition of William James, Pargament highlights the role of spirituality in the lives of clients and psychotherapists and critically examines the assessment and treatment implications. Drawing on research and clinical examples, he describes important and often overlooked ways that attention to spirituality can be integrated into psychotherapy. This book should be of interest to both the novice and seasoned psychotherapist, and will also challenge practitioners and educators in other domains to consider when and how to address issues of spirituality. This is an important book that should stimulate much debate."--Donald Meichenbaum, PhD, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada&nbsp;"From one of our foremost thinkers in psychology and religion, this book provides an up-to-the minute, spiritually informed approach to helping people. The strength of the book is its general applicability for most clients who are spiritually attuned. It is the best available resource of its kind for practicing therapists, and would be a great supplemental text for psychotherapy courses. Easy reading--brilliant thinking."--Everett L. Worthington, Jr., PhD, Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University&nbsp;"A remarkable combination of clinical acumen and spiritual sensitivity--there is nothing like it in the literature. This book is clearly the work of a mature clinician with a wide range of experiences to draw upon. It offers a wonderful balance of the theoretical and the practical, is genuinely ecumenical and open in its orientation, and is approachable by members of any religious community (or no religious community). Psychotherapists of all persuasions will welcome this book, and it would be an ideal text for any course in spirituality and psychotherapy or pastoral counseling."--James W. Jones, PsyD, PhD, Department of Religion, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey&nbsp;"Exceptional. Pargament offers a sweeping, well-balanced view of spirituality from a clinical perspective, without reducing spirituality to psychology. Through a clear command of existing theory and research, compelling clinical vignettes, wonderful quotations, practical recommendations, and his own gracious therapeutic attitude, Pargament gently reminds the reader that spirituality is a legitimate--often pivotal--dimension of clinical practice. He has 'done the work' for the rest of us who may wonder how to address spirituality within a professional context. Clinicians at all levels of experience will grow by reading, and rereading, this book."--Christopher Germer, PhD, private practice, Arlington, Massachusetts<p>"What is spirituality, as distinct from religiousness? What is its impact on our lives? Are there psychological approaches that incorporate the client's spiritual values and yearnings? Are these approaches effective? Free of jargon and accessible to all mental health professionals, this volume speaks with clarity, sympathy, and wisdom that make it hard to put down. As a therapist, Pargament interweaves the text with delightful clinical vignettes; as a researcher, he explains the studies on spirituality in everyday life and in therapy in a most compelling way. This book is a wake-up call to the mental health profession."--David Greenberg, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Herzog Hospital, and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel</p>"This is a book for psychotherapists who take spirituality seriously--their own and that of their clients--and who want to include it in their scope of practice as helpers. In clear prose and with many illustrative case examples, Pargament addresses practical issues of providing spiritually integrated therapy and counseling. He cogently argues that spirituality cannot truly be separated from psychotherapy; to practice without considering this vital dimension of human nature is to risk missing, misunderstanding, and mishandling fundamental struggles of the inner life."--William R. Miller, PhD, Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry, (Emeritus), University of New Mexico<br><br>"The author has put together a theory that integrates spirituality with psychotherapy that can help inform both students and practitioners interested in this still-emerging area of practice. As such, this text will likely prove useful to students and practitioners alike.", <i>Clinical Social Work Journal</i> Published On: 2011-07-03<br><br>"A remarkable book....One thing is certain&#x2015;many people today want spiritually sensitive help, and psychotherapists need a framework that enables them to provide that help. Pargament gives us the framework, taking willing readers on a journey that leads to a deeper understanding of spirituality and the domain of the sacred. Pargament has a knack for articulating the ineffable....Contains rich and robust clinical examples, and Pargament is not shy in sharing with us how he has grown with his clients and what he has learned from them.", <i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i> Published On: 2011-07-03<br><br>"[Pargament] provides a rationale for psychologically understanding the role of the sacred in the lives of clients. He details ways that spirituality can be of invaluable help in a client's psychological struggles. He also describes many ways that a stunted and stagnant spirituality needs to be addressed as it contributes to a client's psychological despair. Next, Pargament discusses ways of addressing spirituality in psychotherapy....The volume is filled with concrete and practical examples that clearly illustrate Pargament's concepts....This volume is important and well timed....Illuminates the ways that psychotherapy ultimately is a journey into the mystery of the other. In this regard, the book is filled with wisdom.

After a fateful encounter with a high initiate of the ancient Fellowship of Isis, she began researching the history of Judaism and Christianity to find out how and when the Divine Feminine became lost. She discovered a forgotten age when the Creator was honored as female and humanity lived in peaceful societies completely free of war. She shows how we can return to an age of peace and celestial light if we work to bring the masculine and feminine energies of the world back into balance. <br><br>Sharing her journey into the heart of the Divine Mother, McCannon details her initiation into the Fellowship of Isis, a process rich with ceremony, ritual, and myths of the Goddess from ancient Egyptian, Celtic, Greek, Hebrew, and Native American traditions. She reveals how the many archetypes of the Goddess, including Isis, Ishtar, Brigit, and the Black Madonna, can become our allies for self-transformation. She explores Mysteries at the heart of Christianity that have remained hidden for nearly 2,000 years and how the Gnostic goddess Sophia is tied to the Second Coming, Mary Magdalene, and the Female Christ. She reveals the lost teachings of Jesus about the Divine Mother and Father and about the Divine Daughter and Son.<br><br>Through her story and her in-depth research, McCannon takes us on a journey to awaken the creative power of the Divine Feminine within each of us. Equipped with the teachings of the Goddess, we gain the mastery to overcome the deeply rooted masculine-feminine imbalance of the patriarchy and to embark into the future as <i>Homo luminous</i>, beings of light.</p><p>Tricia McCannon is a renowned clairvoyant, teacher, and mystical symbologist. She is the author of two books, <i>Dialogues with the Angels</i> and <i>Jesus: The Explosive Story of the 30 Lost Years and the Ancient Mystery Religions</i>.

The director of the Phoenix Fire Lodge Mystery School, she lives in Atlanta, Georgia.<b>5 The Circle Convenes</b> <br> <br>February 2nd. Brigit&#x2019;s Day. I could just make out Shasta&#x2019;s cottage against the gloaming indigo sky as I parked on the dead-end street leading to her house. Tonight was the first meeting of the sacred Circle, and as I made my way slowly up the shadowed walk onto the wide wooden porch, I could feel my heart beating in my chest. I opened the front door to see the merry crackle of a winter&#x2019;s fire and several women seated in a circle on the floor. They looked up as I entered and smiled. I took my seat quietly on the large open cushion waiting for me, feeling the deep magic of the house enveloping us in its arms. <br> <br>As the ladies began to introduce themselves I learned that these were intelligent, articulate women who ranged from homemakers to international directors of companies. Shasta greeted us warmly. &#x201c;Welcome to the Circle of the Goddess. Tonight we begin a journey in to the heart of the Mysteries. The Goddess teaches a path that all life is sacred and that the intelligence that moves through the Universe moves through each of us as well. <br> <br>&#x201c;Throughout the centuries the Goddess has been known by many different names. In Christianity she is called Mary, the great Mother of Compassion. In Judaism she is known as Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom. In India, China, and Japan she is Lakshmi, the Mother of Generosity. She is also Sarasvati, the Goddess of Creativity; Durga, the vanquisher of demons; Parvati, the Mother of the Universe; and Kali, the Great Transformer who rules the cycles of death and rebirth. These are only a few of her many faces.&#x201d; <br> <br>Shasta looked around the circle. Our eyes were wide with wonder. I had never even heard of most of these goddesses. <br> <br>&#x201c;Honoring the Goddess was the first theology of our ancestors. They believed that the Creator of the Universe was female, but people have forgotten who she is and the world has fallen out of balance. Our path is about remembering her place in Creation and restoring balance to the world. In the end this path is also about discovering the divine spark within every creature and within every one of you.&#x201d; Her words fell into a deep place within me. <br> <br>&#x201c;The Goddess gives birth to all that lives, and she takes back into herself all that ever was in the cyclical patterns of life and regeneration. We women have all of the same characteristics as the Goddess--we bleed, we give birth, we tend to the dying, and we celebrate the many natural transitions of life. <br> <br>&#x201c;In Egypt she was known as Isis. Her husband was Osiris. She was a sister, daughter, mother, wife, widow, and queen. Isis became the savior goddess whose cunning and insight helped rescue Egypt from 350 years of darkness.&#x201d; <br> <br>Our faces were rapt with attention. &#x201c;Isis lies within every woman, and every woman is Isis, for we each have the potential to experience all of these aspects of ourselves. Isis established the first Mystery Schools in Egypt, which taught that it is the balance between the male and the female that brings us to mastery. If we neglect either side of our natures we cannot achieve it.&#x201d; The light from the fire danced across her face as we drank in her words. <br> <br>&#x201c;For more than 7,000 years Isis was worshipped in temples across the world. And for the past two millennia she has continued to be honored as Mary Magdalene, another widow married to a great world savior.&#x201d; <br><br>A collective gasp echoed through the room. <i>Mary Magdalene?</i> <i>What did she have to do with Isis? </i>&#x201c;Mary the Magdala, or Mary the Great, was trained as a Priestess of Isis in the temples of Egypt. The knowledge of who she really was, the female equivalent or partner of Christ, was forced to go underground by the patriarchy, although Jesus had called her &#x2018;The Apostle who knew the All.&#x2019;&#x201d; The entire room seemed to be holding its breath. <br> <br>Shasta resumed, &#x201c;We will speak more of these subjects in the months to come, but tonight we begin our year of study on the Eve of Candlemas, one of the eight High Holy Days of the year.&#x201d; Shasta passed candles around the circle. &#x201c;In the Celtic world February 2nd was the Festival of Brigit, a Triple Goddess with three major forms--the maiden, the mother, and the crone. Brigit governed the arts of healing, knowledge, agriculture, and smithcraft, and she was also the patron goddess of writing. Her temples at Kildare in Ireland had clear-running springs and a fire that was constantly maintained in the temples by the priests and priestesses. This fire was dedicated to truth, illumination, and knowledge.&#x201d; <br> <br>Shasta lit her candle and then touched the flame to the candle next to her, passing the light around the Circle. &#x201c;Brigit&#x2019;s symbols are the sacred flame of illumination and the waters of eternal healing, symbols that were also sacred to Isis. Tonight we light these candles for them--for Brigit, Isis, and Mary Magdalene, the hidden brides whose light must be rekindled in the world.&#x201d; <br> <br>I reflected on how Brigit&#x2019;s holiday fell in the winter season of greatest darkness. She was the bringer of hope and light. Perhaps now, when the world has forgotten the light of the feminine face of God, we could help her return. <br> <br>Shasta was speaking. &#x201c;We light candles to Brigit to affirm that despite the seeming darkness we believe light and love and truth will return and that all the people of the Earth will one day awaken from their spiritual slumber.&#x201d; It seemed to me that our tiny flames symbolized the hope of women everywhere that there would soon come a time when women were not beaten, marginalized, or oppressed, a time when the light would dawn once again for women across the world, and with it healing would come to the Earth.</p><h2>A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters</h2><p>A one-of-a-kind kanji study guide that introduces joyo kanji along with detailed, authentic notes about the historical development of each.

We think of back-breaking fieldwork on plantations. We don&#x2019;t think of slavery in the North, nor do we think of the grueling labor of urban and domestic slaves.

She flees her disastrous marriage and sets up as a professional artist a highly unusual and daring step for a woman of her time.&nbsp; Brontï¿½&#x2019;s message remains relevant in a time when the dangerous lover not unlike the dark and mesmerizing Heathcliff and Rochester respectively of Emily Brontï¿½&#x2019;s <i>Wuthering Heights </i>and Charlotte Brontï¿½&#x2019;s <i>Jane Eyre</i> still lurks in romance narratives, and the belief in the beautiful illusion of saving the lost soul through love retains its seductive power.&nbsp;</p><p>Over a short period in the 1840s, the three Brontï¿½ sisters working in a remote English <br>parsonage produced some of the best-loved and most-enduring of all novels: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, a book that created a scandal when it was published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelling in its imaginative power and bold naturalism, the novel opens in the autumn of 1827, when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Brontï¿½'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Brontï¿½ scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Brontï¿½, with all the Brontï¿½ taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Brontï¿½." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

The tale unfolds through a series of letters between two friends as one man learns more about Helen Huntingdon and the past that brought this young painter and single mother to Wildfell Hall.

Henry Kamen's impressive new book offers a fresh and highly original answer.</p><p>Empire is a global survey of the two and a halt centuries (from the late fifteenth to the mid-eighteenth) in which the Spaniards established the most extensive empire the world had ever known, ranging from Naples and the Netherlands to the Philippines. Unlike previous accounts, which have presented the Empire as a direct consequence of Spanish power, this provocative work of history emphasizes the inability of Spain to run an imperial enterprise by itself The role of conquest was deceptive. Spain's rise to power was actually made possible by the collaboration of international business interests, including Italian financiers, German technicians and Dutch traders, in the task of setting up networks of contact ranging across the oceans. At the height of its apparent power, the Spanish Empire was in reality a global enterprise in which non-Spaniards -- Portuguese, Basque, Aztec, Genoese, Chinese, Flemish, West African, Incan and Neapolitan -- played an essential role. It is this vast diversity of resources and people (which included many of its greatest adventurers and soldiers) that made Spain's power so overwhelming.</p><p>There is no better account in English of this time. Henry Kamen's book provides a highly relevant analysis of the origins and nature of imperial power, and of global economic activity. Challenging, persuasive and unique in its thesis, Empire explores Spain's complex impact on world history with admirable clarity and intelligence.</p></p><p><p>Henry Kamen is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society in London and an emeritus professor of the Higher Council for Scientific Research in Barcelona. He is the author of <em>Empire: How Spain Became a Great Power, 1492-1763</em>, as well as several other books on Spain. He divides his time between Barcelona and the United States.</p>Whether the term "globalization" is defined as the global imposition of a hegemonic culture or as a more creative dynamic of global interactivity, it's nothing new-it can be traced at least as far back as the Spanish Empire of the 16th and 17th centuries. Kamen (The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision) depicts this golden age globalization on a suitably grand canvas, tracing the surprisingly hesitant and serendipitous spread of empire from Naples to Manila. He demonstrates to superb effect that this empire was in its very origins a truly multinational enterprise in which the Spanish element was one among many. This element, he suggests, was wholly-if understandably-distorted by contemporary propagandists. In reality, without Genoese bankers, expansionism into the Canary Islands (and Italy itself) would have been unworkable; without Muslim agency, Granada would not have fallen, nor Tenochtitlan without indigenous collaboration; there were Greeks, Netherlanders and at least two blacks in the party that conquered the Aztec capital. Like David Northrup in his recent study, Africa's Discovery of Europe, Kamen restores agency to those who have been relegated to victim status: the black people who helped forge colonial society, and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. While he recognizes that empire catalyzed Spanish patriotism, not least a regressive nostalgia among settlers in the New World, he observes that among those who cried out "Espaï¿½a!" at the battle of Muhlberg (1547) were crack Hungarian cavalry. While memories of empire (not quite so dead as Kamen claims) continue to shape Spanish culture, and as new forms of global imperialism develop, this sophisticated and broad-minded book could not be more timely. 16 pages of color illus., 11 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hara Diagnosis: Reflections on the Sea</h2><p>This work presents the theory and practice of abdominal diagnosis with the greatest care ever applied to an important diagnostic technique. Beginning with an historical and cultural perspective on the use of palpation in general, and abdominal palpation in particular, the book details the information required to master and extend the techniques presented. Introductory chapters concern the role of the emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of Chinese medicine. Detailed etymologies, historical context, and classical sources are used to acquire a greater insight into hun, po, zhi, jing, and shen, as well as many other seminal concepts. <p>The text offers an exceptionally well detailed exploration of interior meridian pathways and the role of classical Chinese energetic anatomy, including concepts such as source and origin. This is followed by a description of the anatomy and physiology of the body's energetically active fascial system, drawn from the latest Western studies, that establishes the authors' rationale for acupuncture based in a complex biological information system. Detailed, step-by-step procedures for practical diagnosis and therapy are accompanied by profuse illustrations and useful case histories. </p><p>The treatment systems described are coordinated through the abdominal patterns and are staged from the general to the specific. Therapies and techniques include hara shiatsu, sotai and breathing exercises, and five-phase treatments. Clear instructions are provided for using Manaka's ion pumping cords, mu point diagnosis, O-ring diagnosis, and secondary diagnostic and treatment strategies such as palm diagnosis. The text concludes with a full description of biorhythmic treatment procedures drawn from the Da Cheng and Dr. Manaka's practice. This chapter contains the information necessary to use the biorhythms, including tables for the bi-hourly and daily meridian rhythms, stem-branch rhythms, the ten-day cycle of the phases and source points, and the sixty-day cycle of the extraordinary vessels. The point associations are detailed, as are the selection procedures. </p><p>The text presents everything that is required for a practitioner to begin clinical application. Hara Diagnosis is replete with useful therapeutic and diagnostic information, clinical and theoretical insight, and approaches to the understanding of acupuncture that draw East and West ever closer. It is the first text generated in the U.S. that has been favorably received by Japanese practitioners.</p></p><p>This is a quite unique book in the field. The title does not capture the breadth of information covered in this text. The authors not only compiled historical and modern uses of hara diagnosis (abdominal palpation) in the field of East Asian medicine, but also attempted a compilation of historical and modern literatures in an effort to explain how and why Japanese practitioners have placed such a strong emphasis on hara diagnosis. After introducing the historical literature, the text examines the several important concepts and models that are found in the early literature. In particular the internal pathways of the extraordinary vessels are discussed in detail. Mental and emotional correspondences and concepts in East Asian medicine are also discussed. The source theories of the <i>Ling Shu</i> and especially the <i>Nan Jing</i> are described in some detail. The concepts of the moving qi between the kidneys and the triple burner are described at great length, and in more detail than in most other books. Historical ideas about the anatomical basis of the triple burner and the channel systems, and speculations about the embryological development of these systems are also described. Modern anatomical correlates are postulated, examining the possible anatomical basis of the channel systems, extraordinary vessels, triple burner and moving qi between the kidneys, including detailed discussions about possible embryological correlations. Although speculative in nature, these discussions compile a wide and very interesting variety of theories that can extend our understanding of acupuncture. <p>The clinical chapters of the text describe basic methods of examining the hara, the various palpatory findings and their general interpretations. This is followed by a large chapter on abdominal shiatsu, and a compilation of traditional Japanese massage methods. The use of hara diagnosis in meridian therapy and especially in the work of Dr. Yoshio Manaka are detailed. The last two chapters extend Manaka's ideas compiling a variety of clinically useful ideas and methods including the system of open points. These chapters on the work of Manaka serve as a good introduction to the use of ion-pumping cords, and Manaka's general treatment approach.</p></p><h2>Trails Plowed Under: Stories of the Old West</h2><p>&#34;Russell writes easily, and in the vernacular.

This beautiful volume, illustrated with 30 new images by master engraver Barry Moser, gathers writings from the full span of Mark Twain&#x2019;s career and elucidates his special attachment to and regard for animals. What may surprise even longtime readers and fans is that Twain was an early and ardent animal welfare advocate, the most prominent American of his day to take up that cause. Edited and selected by Shelley Fisher Fishkin, who has also supplied an introduction and afterword, <i>Mark Twain&#x2019;s Book of Animals</i> includes stories that are familiar along with those that are appearing in print for the first time.</p><p>"For those unaware&#x2014;as I was until I read this book&#x2014;that Mark Twain was one of America's early animal advocates, Shelley Fisher Fishkin's collection of his writings on animals will come as a revelation. Many of these pieces are as fresh and lively as when they were first written, and it's wonderful to have them gathered in one place." &#x2014;Peter Singer, author of <i>Animal Liberation</i> and <i>The Life You Can Save</i><br><br>&#x201c;A truly exhilarating work. Mark Twain's animal-friendly views would not be out of place today, and indeed, in certain respects, Twain is still ahead of us: claiming, correctly, that there are certain degraded practices that only humans inflict on one another and upon other animals. Fishkin has done a splendid job: I cannot remember reading something so consistently excellent."&#x2014;Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, author of <i>When Elephants Weep</i> and <i>The Face on Your Plate</i><br><br>"Shelley Fisher Fishkin has given us the lifelong arc of the great man's antic, hilarious, and subtly profound explorations of the animal world, and she's guided us through it with her own trademark wit and acumen.

It blends a familiar language with the formalism and cadence of Victorian descriptions, all the while maintaining clear directions on dissection procedures, and amazing, realistic, art, rendering its reading a vivid experience. It is strongly based in the conceptual framework of phylogeny but without losing the practical spirit of manuals. The incorporation of new sections on examples often not (or ever) included in other works is a bonus that broadens its scope, flexibility, and utility." <b>--Dr Sergio F Vizcaino, Departmento Cientifico Paleontologia Vertebrados, Museo de la Plata, Argentina</b></p> <p>"This new lab manual by De Iuliis and Pulerï¿½ will quickly become the standard for veterinary and vertebrate zoology courses alike. The artwork is simply the best available, and appears more true-to-life than any others. The choice of including skeletal material beyond the standard fare (including T. rex!) makes this manual truly innovative. The text clearly explains the anatomy, and goes into more detail than any similar manual, allowing the instructor to more easily tailor the manual to his or her course.

Richard Davis tells the story of this venerable and enduring book, from its origins in ancient India to its reception today as a spiritual classic that has been translated into more than seventy-five languages. The <i>Gita</i> opens on the eve of a mighty battle, when the warrior Arjuna is overwhelmed by despair and refuses to fight. He turns to his charioteer, Krishna, who counsels him on why he must. In the dialogue that follows, Arjuna comes to realize that the true battle is for his own soul.</p><p>Davis highlights the place of this legendary dialogue in classical Indian culture, and then examines how it has lived on in diverse settings and contexts. He looks at the medieval devotional traditions surrounding the divine character of Krishna and traces how the <i>Gita</i> traveled from India to the West, where it found admirers in such figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Aldous Huxley. Davis explores how Indian nationalists like Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda used the <i>Gita</i> in their fight against colonial rule, and how contemporary interpreters reanimate and perform this classical work for audiences today.</p><p>An essential biography of a timeless masterpiece, this book is an ideal introduction to the <i>Gita</i> and its insights into the struggle for self-mastery that we all must wage.</p></p><p><p>"This is an exciting book about an exciting book, namely, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, a text in which Hinduism comes closest to possessing a universal scripture.

First performed around 1600, this a gripping and exuberant drama of revenge, rich in contrasts and conflicts. Its violence alternates with introspection, its melancholy with humour, and its subtlety with spectacle. The Prince, Hamlet himself, is depicted as a complex, divided, introspective character. His reflections on death, morality and the very status of human beings make him &#39;the first modern man&#39;.</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam.

In this immediate sequel to Plan B (1999), which is recommended reading for those who wish to get the most out of this one, the action is nonstop from the first page, as the members of Clan Korval, fleeing from the Department of the Interior, aid their allies of Clan Erob in defeating the invasion of the Yxtrangs, a nasty militarized culture with overtones of ancient Sparta. The Department hopes to neutralize all clan members, except for the last Korval on Liad, the ne'er-do-well Pat Rin yos'Phelium, whom they intend to turn into a puppet. But Pat Rin has unexpected depths, no use for the Department's plans and several schemes of his own. Meanwhile, the Department tracks Val Con yos'Phelium, a former Agent of Change for the Department, to his hideout, hoping to capture him alive and use him "as both bait and bridle to the remainder of Korval." A cliff-hanger ending leaves a number of story lines unresolved until, hopefully, the next title in the series. Purely escapist this book may be (perhaps not a bad thing at this moment in history), but the authors' craftsmanship is top-notch, recalling the work of Elizabeth Moon and Lois McMaster Bujold, as well as, at a less exalted level, the military SF of writers like Robert Frezza. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Give Me Liberty!: An American History, Second Seagull Edition, Volume 1</h2><p><p><strong>Concise, clear, compact, Eric Foner&#x2019;s brilliant synthesis of American history is the perfect teaching tool for the U.S. survey course.</strong></p> Unlike so many textbooks that overwhelm beginning students with encyclopedic detail, <em>Give Me Liberty!</em> presents the events of American history in a nimble chronological narrative that equips students to understand their significance.

Why? When the researchersanalyzed the behaviors of eight hundred salespeople on sales calls they foundthat only &#x201c;37% of salespeople&#x2014;were consistently effective. What&#x2019;s more, some ofthe behaviors of the remaining 63% actually drove down performance.&#x201d;1 In otherwords, the way that these salespeople were selling was actually preventing themfrom making the sale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately,these salespeople are not alone in their struggle. Lack of sales production isa devastating problem. In fact, surveys that measure the sales performance ofthousands of companies found that 38 to 49 percent of all salespeople do notmake quota every year.2 This means that roughly four to five out of every tenprofessional salespeople fail to meet the minimum standard their company hasplaced on them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The way thatsalespeople sell is a mission critical issue, because the behaviors they usewhen interacting with potential customers is a determining factor in the buyingdecision. For instance, when the performance measurement firm Chally Groupconducted a series of studies examining the buying behaviors of more than100,000 decision makers, they identified the salesperson as a deciding factorin whether buyers chose to purchase from one vendor or another.3 In addition,research published by CEB, a leading advisory company, found that 53 percent ofcustomer loyalty&#x2014;customers choosing to buy from a company repeatedly&#x2014;is not theresult of the product, company, or service, but the behaviors salespeople usewhen selling.4 Every day, the fates of careers and companies hinge onsalespeople because they serve two imperative functions: creating customers andproducing revenue to keep their organization alive. As Peter Drucker, legendarymanagement expert and author of many culture-shifting business books, famouslysaid, &#x201c;There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create acustomer.&#x201d;5 That said, there is no doubt that selling has become morechallenging than ever. The marketplace is extremely competitive. Potentialcustomers are blitzed by sellers fighting to earn their business. At the sametime, buyers are extremely busy and have less time to deal with salespeople. Tofurther complicate the situation, as I mentioned in the introduction,technology allows buyers to research potential solutions online before talkingto a seller. As a result, salespeople are entering into the buyer&#x2019;s decisionprocess later than ever before. The data indicates that around 60 percent ofthe buying cycle is completed before a salesperson is able to engage apotential client. Because of these new realities, salespeople have no room forerror. They are selling in an extremely complex and competitive environmentwhere they must battle competitors for every sale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To make mattersworse, these daunting challenges aren&#x2019;t the only reasons salespeople are struggling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NATURAL ABILITY IS NO LONGER ENOUGH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For years, many in the sales community believed thatsuccess in selling is dependent on innate communication skills and a gregariouspersonality. The assumption has been, if you didn&#x2019;t have &#x201c;it,&#x201d; you couldn&#x2019;t betaught it. However, a tidal wave of scientific research studying what makespeople successful has disproven that idea in recent decades.6 Though somepeople do have heightened levels of natural ability, talent is not enough tobecome a top performing salesperson. Because of the exceptionally crowdedmarketplace, you must continually improve your knowledge and skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be successful in sales today, you must sell beyondyour natural ability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One fascinatingexample of this is seen in the work of Carol Dweck, professor of psychology atStanford University, who has conducted several studies on how one&#x2019;s mentalityinfluences one&#x2019;s performance.7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has foundthat people tend to embrace one of two common outlooks:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed mindset:the belief that you can do little to change your abilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growthmindset: the belief that through effort you can improve your abilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is a shortquiz that will help you identify what mindset you have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>QUIZ</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which of the following statements do you believe to betrue?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your abilityto sell is part of who you are and not something you can change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter howgood you are at sales, you can always improve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can learnnew selling strategies, but you can&#x2019;t change much about your ability toinfluence others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling is askill that you can develop, regardless of your natural talent or personality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Options 1 and 3are fixed mindset statements, while options 2 and 4 are growth mindsetstatements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So do these mindsets influence sales results? Yes,because the outcomes these mentalities produce are radically different. Thosewho have a growth mindset are far more likely to be successful than those whodon&#x2019;t.8 One of the main reasons a growth mindset drives high achievement isbecause it alters how the brain perceives failure. Those with fixed mindsetsare more prone to see failure as a judgment on themselves. If they fail, theyfeel like failures. In contrast, people with a growth mindset view failure asthe feedback that shows them how to adapt and take their abilities to the nextlevel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years,I have witnessed the vast difference in performance between salespeople who arecontent to rely on their giftedness to bring in enough sales to squeak by(fixed mindset) and those who work hard to surpass their natural aptitude toachieve or beat their sales goals each year (growth mindset). In fact, this isone of the things I recommend that sales leaders test for when hiring for anopen sales position. (We&#x2019;ll talk more about how to do this in Chapter 10.)Those with a growth outlook are more motivated to succeed and, as a result, farmore likely to become top performers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What about you?If you have a growth mindset, great! If you have a fixed mindset, you shouldaddress it because it will hinder your ability to achieve the level of successyou desire. The good news is that your mindset is your mindset, and you canchange it. By choosing to embrace the new, empowering belief that your salesskills are like a muscle that needs to be continually strengthened, you willinspire the work ethic necessary to achieve high levels of sales performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SALES TRAINING HASN&#x2019;T BECOME MANDATORY . . . YET</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why do elite salespeople make selling look effortless?It&#x2019;s easy to assume they have always been terrific at selling. But restassured, they make selling look easy because they have been capably trained.Science has shown that these individuals&#x2019; brains have been altered by training,and this is what allows them to competently execute selling behaviors. Let meexplain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; People used tobelieve that the human brain was static, remaining unchanged through adulthood.However, neuroscientists have recently demonstrated that the brain containsneurons that are constantly changing based on one&#x2019;s thoughts, behaviors, andexperiences.9 Neuroscientists describe the brain&#x2019;s flexibility as&#x201c;neuroplasticity.&#x201d;10</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you learnany new behavior, your brain changes and new neural pathways are created. Themore these neural connections are used the more they develop and, as a result,the more proficient you become at the activity they are associated with.11</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesanalyzed the brains of experienced London taxi drivers who were skilled atnavigating the complex streets of London.12 The researchers identified that thepart of the taxi drivers&#x2019; brains (the hippocampus) that deals with spatialrelationships (navigation) had grown in size and contained an elevated numberof neural networks. Essentially, these taxi drivers had changed their brains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In much the sameway, when salespeople go through effective training, their brains are beingrewired. New clusters of neurons are formed and existing clusters connectedwith previously learned behaviors are strengthened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are twofascinating examples that illustrate how training reprograms the brain andequips people to perform well beyond their natural abilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Behavioralscientist K. Anders Ericsson has led a series of research studies over analmost thirty-year period on how training can produce exceptional levels ofperformance. In one of his most famous studies, Ericsson and two otherresearchers studied how memory could be enhanced with continuous training.13They recruited a college student (whom they referred to by his initials, S.F.)with a normal IQ and memory; after listening to a sequence of numbers, he couldrecall around seven digits. After several hundred hours of memory enhancementtraining, S.F. drastically exceeded the goal of the training (fourteen digits)and was able to memorize eighty-two random digits. Just so you appreciate theimpact of this, below are eighty-two random numbers. Read through them and trymemorizing all these yourself. It&#x2019;s harder than it looks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 4 7 9 3 6 2 5 3 2 6 8 9 1 1 0 3 6 3 2 6 1 7 3 4 6 2 7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>9 0 1 4 9 7 8 2 5 2 3 5 1 7 9 2 8 4 5 2 7 9 2 1 4 0 5 9</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6 3 7 0 5 2 7 9 5 6 6 8 2 1 7 2 0 8 6 4 8 6 9 5 2 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchersattributed the vast improvement of his memory to his use of mnemonicassociations&#x2014;such as converting random numbers into running times, so 247became 2 minutes 47 seconds&#x2014;and relentless training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The effects oftraining on memory performance have been replicated many times by numerousresearchers and participants.14 When behavioral scientists from Florida StateUniversity analyzed the decades of research in this area they concluded thatthere is no &#x201c;evidence that would limit the ability of motivated and healthyadults to achieve exceptional levels of memory performance given access toinstruction and supportive training environments.&#x201d;15 Even more fascinating isthat when Ericsson and others analyzed how those in other professions such asbusiness, music, mathematics, and sports become experts capable of superiorperformances, they found that it was due to continual training.16</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anotherintriguing example of how training can significantly boost skill levels is seenin the work of Betty Edwards, an art teacher who takes people with ordinaryabilities and teaches them how to draw impressive self-portraits. Sheaccomplishes this feat not in years, months, or even weeks. She does thiswithin a mere five days. In her book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of theBrain, Edwards writes that once a person understands the technical componentsof drawing, he or she will progress rapidly with focused practice.17 Sheemphasizes that most people do not lack drawing skills, but rather seeingskills. She maintains that once she shows her students how to perceive thingssuch as edges, spaces, lighting, shadows, and relationships among objects,their ability to draw quickly improves. On the next page are some examples ofthe self-portraits her students drew on the first day of the class and the samestudents&#x2019; drawings on day five.18</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, I havewitnessed salespeople who were struggling to keep their jobs go throughhigh-quality sales training and transform their careers. Salespeople cannotsell beyond their training. Why? Because the training they receive is whatcreates their philosophy of selling, which I refer to as &#x201c;sales truth.&#x201d; Theseare the core beliefs that govern how they sell, and especially which salesactivities, behaviors, strategies, and skills they use or ignore. As professorsat the Leavey School of Business James Kouzes and Barry Posner confirm, &#x201c;theinvestment in training will pay off in the long term. People can&#x2019;t deliver onwhat they don&#x2019;t know how to do . . . you have to upgrade capabilities.&#x201d;19 Theway you do that is by training them how to do something better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#x2019;s more, intoday&#x2019;s hypercompetitive marketplace, if salespeople do not receive propertraining they will fall behind; selling, like any other skill, must bedeveloped. This is why a competent, well-trained sales team is often acompany&#x2019;s most significant advantage&#x2014;and an incompetent one its biggestliability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As intertwinedas sales training is with the success of salespeople, sales leaders, andcompanies, there is a glaring problem with modern sales training: most of itdoes not properly equip salespeople to sell in today&#x2019;s challenging businessenvironment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MODERN SALES TRAINING HAS NOT ADAPTED TO THE NEW SELLINGCLIMATE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The marketplace has radically changed, but sales traininghas not. No longer can salespeople get by using the same old selling strategiesthat have been used for generations. (I will share some of these antiquated andineffective strategies with you later in the chapter and throughout this book.)This is why, alarmingly, when salespeople go through sales training, much of itmakes little difference in their job performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,research published by both ES Research Group and CEB has identified that 85 to90 percent of all sales training has no positive impact after the training.20Now, this does not negate the need for competent training, but it doesilluminate the fact that modern sales training is failing salespeople.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you addtogether the fact that most of sales training makes no impact on the salesresults of trainees and the widespread lack of sales production that wasdiscussed at the beginning of this chapter, you start to see the scope of theproblem. There is something horribly wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many in theprofession of sales realize this problem exists, but they fail to properlyidentify the cause. Often, the finger is pointed at a variety of concerns, suchas:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Failing to follow-up and reinforce training</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ineffectively leveraging technology (social selling)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making training an event, not a process</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Improperly assessing sales people before training (thustrying to solve the wrong problem)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Participants or management not buying in sufficiently</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not linking the training with the strategic initiativesof the company</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure, eachof these issues should be addressed, but the eviden...</p></p><h2>A Tale of Two Cities (Retold Classic Novels)</h2><p>A classic tale of love, adventure, and sacrifice set during the French Revolution.</p><p>&#34;I am extremely pleased with your Retold Classic Novels and your Parallel Text for Shakespeare.

A Top 10 Finalist for the Global Teacher Prize and one of NPR&#x2019;s 50 Greatest Teachers, he has presented at the White House on two separate occasions and had his classroom modeled by the U.S. Botanic Garden. His work has been featured by major media and documentaries, including Michael Pollan&#x2019;s <i>In Defense of Food</i>, and his TEDx talk has been viewed over one million times. Dubbed the Pied Piper of Peas, Ritz and his family reside in the Bronx and continue to farm with children all year round. His demonstration classroom, the National Health, Wellness, and Learning Center, is located at Community School 55 in the South Bronx.PART I <br> PREPARING THE SOIL<br> &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER 1 <br>THE ROOKIE &nbsp;<br><br> Summer 1984&#x2014;I hobbled down the metal stairs of the Jackson Avenue subway stop in the South Bronx with my knee in a brace that ran from my thigh to my ankle. It was so hot, it felt like even the sidewalks were sweating. I was on my way to interview for my first teaching job and didn&#x2019;t want to be late.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like so many young men in my neighborhood who came of age in the early 1980s, I dreamed of finding glory and fortune on the basketball courts. And why not? I was six foot three and wiry, with bottomless energy, a reliable three-point shot, twenty-eight-inch waist, and blue suede Puma sneakers. I could jump pretty well for a white guy, too. Four years of college had given me untold hours to work on my game and party as hard as the cast from&nbsp;<i>Animal House</i>. My goals in college were to spend as much time as possible on the basketball court, make art, and meet girls. It was as if I had been invited to a four-year happy hour. By graduation time, I knew happy very, very well. If I had scholarly classmates who sweated over tests and essays, our paths didn&#x2019;t intersect.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t think about what came next until I graduated, and then I didn&#x2019;t have a clue. I tried playing pro ball during a postgraduation trip to Israel to visit my grandmother. That&#x2019;s where I tore up my knee. The long flight home to New York gave me time to ponder my next career move. My mother, a teacher herself, had told me about the massive shortages facing&nbsp;New York City schools. At her urging, I had taken the test to get a temporary teaching certificate before I headed overseas. While I was away, she fielded calls from principals desperate to interview me.<br> &nbsp;<br> So here I was, ready to give teaching a try. My flight home from Israel had arrived hours late. I had to go to the interview straight from JFK Airport. There was no time to change clothes, let alone stop at a barbershop and tame my mop of curly hair that had been growing all summer. From the neck up, I looked like Peter Frampton with a sunburn. But my legs were whiter than Larry Bird&#x2019;s. Dressed in high-tops and still in my extra-short basketball shorts, I made my way toward my interview as fast as my awkward knee immobilizer would allow.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scene at street level stopped me cold. Underneath the elevated tracks on Westchester Avenue, every surface was covered in graffiti and gang tags. The trains rumbling overhead were like moving murals of spray-painted art. Across the street squatted a one-story, red brick post office with bulletproof windows. Delivery trucks idled in front of the meat warehouse on the opposite corner. Beyond that, what passed for community seemed to just . . . stop. The Bronx that I knew from my boyhood, a place I had romanticized in memory, was long gone. This Bronx might as well have been a scene from post&#x2013;World War II Germany.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lot after lot was abandoned. A fire hydrant spewed water onto the empty street. Piles of bricks, scorched mattresses, twisted metal, and other debris were the only remnants of the apartment buildings that had been burned and bulldozed. Others were simply left standing to rot. Waves of arson fires and vandalism had swept through this neighborhood a decade earlier, and the place still looked scorched and forgotten. Even though I grew up in the Bronx, I had been away long enough to see it with fresh eyes. The destruction felt so recent and so all pervasive, I could practically smell the smoke.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looming on the horizon like a massive stage set, rising up and out of St. Ann&#x2019;s Avenue, was the five-story silhouette of South Bronx High School. It looked haunted. Except for one adjacent building, there was nothing&nbsp;much around it in an eight-block area except blue sky and charred remains. The distant Manhattan skyline could have been from another planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Man, no way you want to teach at South Bronx,&#x201d; my friend T.C. had warned me when I told him about my interview.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; I countered. &#x201c;We both grew up in the Bronx.&#x201d; I left out one important detail. A decade earlier, my parents had fled the excitement of the Bronx for the suburban safety of Rockland County, New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not&nbsp;<i>South</i>&nbsp;Bronx,&#x201d; he reminded me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite T.C.&#x2019;s warnings, I wasn&#x2019;t worried. &#x201c;You know me,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I can get along with anybody, anywhere.&#x201d; Knowing the crowd of characters I hung out with, he didn&#x2019;t disagree.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I started making my way up St. Ann&#x2019;s Avenue, I replayed the warnings about the drugs and violence that I&#x2019;d heard about this neighborhood. Heroin had ravaged the community in the 1960s, followed by a swift and unrelenting wave of cheap cocaine in the late 1970s. Now it was crack: the fast food of street drugs. Anybody with three bucks in his pocket could buy in and get insanely high, if only for ninety seconds.<br> &nbsp;<br> St. Mary&#x2019;s Park, a few blocks on the other side of the train tracks, was designed a century earlier to be an urban paradise. Paths meandered gracefully through greenery, punctuated by big granite boulders. This former oasis had become an open-air drug bazaar. You couldn&#x2019;t walk through it now without hearing the crunch of crack vials under your shoes. Every day, garbage trucks were filled to the brim with nothing but discarded drug paraphernalia.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was a block away from the school, a movement on the top floor caught my eye. Without warning, a chair came flying out of an open window and made a silent and graceful arch toward the street before smacking the asphalt. It bounced and bounced and bounced until it came to rest. The whole scene looked surreal, like a movie in slow motion. The kid who hurled the chair pulled his head back indoors without a word. Nobody came outside to investigate. The only car on the street swerved around the broken chair without slowing down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe it was youthful bravado or maybe I just really needed a job, but those first impressions didn&#x2019;t scare me off. To the contrary, I figured this was the new normal. I simply continued inside the school, where I found the principal holed up in his office. Without ever looking up, he made a quick phone call and introduced me to my soon-to-be supervisor. When the supervisor and I got in the elevator to go up to the fifth floor for the interview, the elevator lurched and dropped dramatically. The doors opened on the bowels of the ancient building. The supervisor stepped out and, without a trace of irony, said, &#x201c;Hmm, this doesn&#x2019;t look like the fifth floor.&#x201d;<br><br> Right then and there, I knew I couldn&#x2019;t go wrong here. The expectations were so low, any warm body would do. In 1984, at South Bronx High School, the bar for teacher competence was simply being able to move your time card from left to right. Punch in on time and that was it! When the supervisor asked me about my background in math and science, I told him I&#x2019;d taken some science classes in high school. In fact, I had aced the Regents Exam in biology.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Great!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be wonderful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On the spot, I accepted his offer to teach every subject to a self-contained class of special education students for something like $9,000 a year. I had no idea what I was getting into.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the first day of class, the assistant principal stopped me just outside my classroom door. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s your room key, your key to the faculty bathroom, and your chalk,&#x201d; he said. He handed me five class rosters filled with names.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait, how long is this supposed to last?&#x201d; I asked him, peering into the flimsy box that held twenty pieces of chalk to use on my cracked blackboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Best wishes&#x2014;good luck!&#x201d; he called out over his shoulder as he disappeared down the hall. That was it, Teaching 101. And so it began: no credentials, no specific degree needed, no special training, not even a workshop, pep session, or tutorial. All it took to get a teaching job in 1984 was a four-year degree in anything, a simple test requiring no preparation&nbsp;or content, and a heartbeat. For me, this seemed like a perfect fit.<br> &nbsp;<br> While I was taking roll that first day, I paused to make eye contact with each student and did my best to memorize every name. At twenty-one, I was the same age as my oldest students who had been held back so many times, they were about to age out of public education while I was just aging in. Many of the boys had more facial hair than I did. The girls had way more attitude. Some students were brand-new immigrants to America, wide-eyed about the promise of public school. Others knew the system all too well; it had failed them for years.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I called out Vanessa&#x2019;s name, I heard chuckles from the back of the room. &#x201c;Is she here?&#x201d; I asked, wondering if she was one of the students who appeared to be napping on their desks. &#x201c;Do we need to wake her up?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. We all know when Vanessa&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; promised a boy with a knowing look.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first day Vanessa bothered to show up for class, I heard her coming before she arrived. Just outside my doorway, she shouted an angry promise down the hall and over her shoulder, &#x201c;What the fuck, yo? I&#x2019;ll beat your ass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t see who she was yelling at, but I couldn&#x2019;t miss Vanessa. This big, belligerent voice came from a short, stocky body. Shaped like a whiskey barrel with arms, she overflowed with fury and aggression. And why? Because it was Tuesday. Because the sun was up. Vanessa didn&#x2019;t need a reason to be mad at the world. She caught me watching her and glared right back. She lifted one eyebrow slightly as if to ask, &#x201c;You gonna fuck with me, too?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Right away, she asked for a hall pass so she could go hang with her friends. Everybody, and especially the boys, watched to see what would happen next. We all knew the principal&#x2019;s ironclad rule: no hall passes during the first five minutes or last five minutes of class. Keeping kids in their seats was his weak solution to curtail fighting in the hallways and bathrooms. He was so insistent on this rule, he made me sign an agreement to abide by it. In fact, that was the only bit of teacher training I was given as preparation for my new job.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please take a seat,&#x201d; I suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vanessa gave me the hard stare that other teachers and even some of her classmates had come to fear. Anything might set her off. That morning, I held the match.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I started, &#x201c;maybe that works with other teachers. But not with me. This is a two-way street. You give what you get and get what you give. You need to be in class.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what I need,&#x201d; she shot back. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t understand me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I understand that if you want to learn anything, you have to put in the effort, and that starts with showing up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you know about what we go through? What do you know about Hispanics? About the Bronx? You don&#x2019;t know nothin&#x2019;. You&#x2019;re here to get a paycheck. And you&#x2019;re just&nbsp;<i>white</i>. Gringo, go home!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I could not argue with her about my skin color, I simply said, &#x201c;You know what, you don&#x2019;t know me.&#x201d; Keeping my voice calmer than I felt, and looking her dead in the eye, I respectfully asked her to take a seat. This time she complied, and I thanked her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vanessa looked shocked when I found her outside at lunchtime and handed her half my sandwich. I didn&#x2019;t brown-bag or eat the slop in the school cafeteria. Instead, I had acquired a taste for the sandwiches made at a local deli. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to know each other,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;This is going to be a long-term relationship, not a drive-by.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you serious, yo?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re giving me half?&#x201d; That made a deeper impression on her than the fact that I was using my own break time to sit down with her. In a neighborhood where children are lucky to get crumbs, half a Boar&#x2019;s Head ham and cheese with mayo&#x2014;known as the &#x201c;ghetto gold standard of sandwiches&#x201d;&#x2014;is a windfall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over many lunches in the weeks that followed, I learned more about her story. Her older brother, deep into drugs, consumed her mother&#x2019;s attention. Vanessa was determined to prove that she could be just as bad if that&#x2019;s what it took to get noticed. Behind that tough exterior, she was hiding superior coping, avoidance, and survival skills. She could be as mean as a pit bull or, when it suited her, as charming as a poodle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her sharp intellect came out in flashes, like when she would deliver a highly sophisticated, exuberantly profane analysis of why public housing sucked. She didn&#x2019;t hesitate to bully other students, smoke weed at recess, or frighten teachers with her temper. When she arrived in my classroom with sweet breath, acting goofy, I knew that she (like so many others) had stopped in the bathroom to guzzle a bottle of Calvin Cooler. This cheap and sugary wine cooler was marketed so heavily in the neighborhood that my students called it Ghetto Kool-Aid. Cheaper than milk or juice, and available in every color of the rainbow, it was often the breakfast beverage of choice that made school far more tolerable for students.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vanessa had no intention of doing homework or following any rules unless they suited her. Most days, though, we managed to get along. On great days, she ran the class for me. A natural leader, Vanessa could quiet an unruly class with a look or get everyone focused on the lesson with an insightful question. When she wanted to learn, it was game on for all.<br><br> As a rookie teacher, I didn&#x2019;t know the meaning of pedagogy. My goal was to stay one lesson ahead of my students. It wasn&#x2019;t hard with the science textbooks I found in the basement. Many of them were written in the 1950s or 1960s. We were reading aloud in class one day when a student raised his hand and said, &#x201c;It says here, &#x2018;One day, man will go to the moon.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Another student chimed in, &#x201c;Yo, you think that&#x2019;s possible?&#x201d; His question made me doubt my own memory for a moment. Was I imagining that moon landing or did it really happen?<br> &nbsp;<br> When I told them about Neil Armstrong and his giant leap for mankind, they just shrugged. Michael Jackson was moonwalking his way across America&#x2014;that was all the lunar knowledge my students understood. For them, a space suit was a black leather jacket with three zippers. For many, information came live and direct via MTV.<br> &nbsp;<br> To compensate for my lack of training, limited supplies, and outdated materials, I trusted my instincts. Growing up in the Bronx in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s had taught me to read the unwritten rules. In densely packed urban spaces, people are constantly sizing each other up. You figure out at a&nbsp;glance whom you can trust, who&#x2019;s willing to make eye contact, and who&#x2019;s hiding an attitude behind sunglasses. A handshake and a promise are as binding as a legal contract. Playing ball taught me more about the value of straight talk. You don&#x2019;t say you can dunk; you just do it. Actions count more than words. To win a bet about my athletic abilities, I had once jumped over a Yugo parked at a South Bronx curb. I collected my payoff and jumped back over it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> I still lived by the same rules I&#x2019;d learned as a boy. As seemingly lawless as the Bronx had become, here and now those rules still mattered. My classroom wasn&#x2019;t apart from the world my students inhabited; it was a part of the same living ecosystem.</p><h2>Land&#39;s Polaroid: A Company and the Man Who Invented It</h2><p>Chronicles the story of Edwin Land, the publicity-shy genius who created the Polaroid Corporation and brought the world instant photography, only to lose control of his own creation</p><p>This biography of Edwin Land, developer of the Polaroid camera and founder of the Polaroid Company, is written by a man who worked with him for 24 years at Polaroid. It presents an inside glimpse of the day-to-day activities and important moments in the life of the man and the company. Unfortunately, the book has numerous personal references and names of people with whom the reader will be unfamiliar. However, it does show the "behind the scenes" activities that are involved in developing and managing a new and successful product and a growing corporation. Grace Klinefelter, Ft. Lauderdale Coll.

First acting as regent for her young nephew/stepson Thutmose III, she in time assumed the title of king and exercised the full powers of the throne as senior co-ruler. In accordance with Egyptian tradition, Hatshepsut was often depicted as a male king. After her death, however, monuments bearing her image were ruthlessly defaced, and her name was erased from historical accounts.<p></p>Hatshepsut&#x2019;s rise to power and the nature of her kingship have long been debated by scholars. This fascinating period, one of immense artistic creativity, is illuminated by this volume&#x2019;s rich presentation of monumental royal sculpture and reliefs, ceremonial objects, exquisite personal items for everyday use, and dazzling jewelry. Essays focus on influences from the neighboring Near East, Nubia, and the Aegean; the innovative architecture built by Hatshepsut; powerful figures in the royal court during her reign; archaeological finds from this period; and mysteries surrounding the destruction of Hatshepsut&#x2019;s statues and the obliteration of her name.<p></p>The first in-depth treatment of the subject, <i>From Queen to Pharoah </i>is an important investigation into the impact of Hatshepsut&#x2019;s reign on the history, culture, and artistic output of Egypt.<p></p></p><p><p>The nearly twenty-year reign of Egypt&#x2019;s female pharaoh Hatshepsut was a period of immense artistic creativity.

M. Barrie&#x2019;s most famous work and arguably the greatest of all children&#x2019;s stories. While it is a wonderful fantasy for the young,<b> Peter Pan</b><i>,</i> particularly in the novel form Barrie published in 1911, says something important to all of us. Here &#x201c;the boy who wouldn&#x2019;t grow up&#x201d; and his adventures with Wendy and the lost boys in the Neverland evoke a deep emotional response as they give form to our feelings about parents, boys and girls, the unknown, freedom, and responsibility. Humorous, satiric, filled with suspenseful cliff-hangers and bittersweet truths, <b>Peter Pan</b><i> </i>works an indisputable magic on readers of all ages, making it a true classic of imaginative literature.</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

The gods really present, in the Catholic sense, were translated into metaphors and symptoms, and into functions of the social and political. Presence became evidence of superstition, of magical thinking, of the infantile and irrational, the primitive and the savage. <i>History and Presence</i> radically confronts this intellectual heritage, proposing instead a model for the study of religion that begins with humans and gods present to each other in the circumstances of everyday life. Orsi then asks what it would mean to write history with the real presence of special beings restored. With reference to Marian apparitions, the cult of the saints, relations with the dead, and other Catholic instances of encounters with the gods really present, Orsi elaborates a theory of presence for the study of both contemporary religion and history.</p><p>The unseeing of the gods was a foundational requirement of Western modernity. Orsi urges us to withhold from absence the intellectual and spiritual prestige modernity encourages us to give it, and instead to approach history with the gods fully present.</p></p><p>Robert A. Orsi is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Grace Craddock Nagle Chair in Catholic Studies at Northwestern University.A fiercely inquisitive book on the heart of Roman Catholicism...The bulk of <i>History and Presence</i> concentrates on...the perception phenomenon at the back of worldwide cults of saints&#x2019; relics, holy shrines, saints&#x2019; cults, apparitions of Mary, and the like. Through very nimble and wide-ranging research, Orsi lays bare the complex intermingling of faith and psychology that has been a key element of Catholicism for five hundred years. One of the persistent strengths of the book is its keen awareness of the day-to-day meaning of its mysteries for the ordinary people involved. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i>)<br><br>With reference to Marian apparitions, the cult of the saints, and other divine&#x2013;human encounters, Orsi constructs a theory of presence for the study of contemporary religion and history. Many interviews with individuals devoted to particular saints and relics are included in this fascinating study of how people process what they believe. (<i>Catholic Herald</i>)<br><br>This book is classic Orsi: careful, layered, humane, and subtle... If reformed theology has led to the gods&#x2019; ostensible absence in modern religion, <i>History and Presence</i> is a sort of counter-reformation literature that revels in the excesses of divine materiality: the contradictions, the redundancies, the scrambling of borders between the sacred and profane, the dead and the living, the past and the present, the original and the imitator... <i>History and Presence</i> is a thought-provoking, expertly arranged tour of precisely those abundant, excessive phenomena which scholars have historically found so difficult to think. (Sonja Anderson <i>Reading Religion</i>)<br><br>[A] brilliant, theologically sophisticated exploration of the Catholic experience of God&#x2019;s presence through the material world...On every level&#x2015;from its sympathetic, honest, and sometimes moving ethnography to its astute analytical observations&#x2015;this book is a scholarly masterpiece. (A. W. Klink <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>Orsi recaptures God&#x2019;s breaking into the world through stories that range from tales of saints, such as Bernadette, to common people who directly experienced divine intervention... The book does an excellent job of explaining both the difficulties and values inherent in recognizing God in the world. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This is a meticulously researched, humane, and deeply challenging book. It concerns the people and the groups for whom heaven and earth, life and death are not separated by absolute boundaries. &#x2018;Gods&#x2019; (to use Orsi&#x2019;s term) cross these boundaries. Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and the beloved dead remain real presences to many, in a modern world that finds no place for them. The story is set against the background of postwar American Catholicism. It has searing moments of desperate hope and unexpected comfort. It also has moments of sheer horror&#x2015;as when Orsi explores what sexual harassment by priests means to those who saw in priests human gateways to heaven. The men and women studied in this book do not belong to &#x2018;a world we have lost.&#x2019; They belong to a world we have lost sight of. (Peter Brown, Princeton University)<br><br>Orsi&#x2019;s evoking of the full reality of the holy in the world is extremely moving, shot through with wonder and horror. Speaking of the sanctuary at Chimayo&#x2015;which the present reviewer has also visited&#x2015;Orsi rejects trauma theory. The well of earth is not a &#x2018;metaphor for suffering,&#x2019; a &#x2018;hole in the mind&#x2019; where suffering spills out; instead, &#x2018;the seeming emptiness is in fact full&#x2019;; the hole is paradoxical; Christ is present in the dirt...There is much that is specifically Catholic about the horrors and glories that Orsi sets out in such carefully researched detail. His argument in a short epilogue that we should see <i>all </i>religious history through a matrix of presence is, nonetheless, convincing. (Caroline Walker Bynum <i>Common Knowledge</i>)<br><br>Perhaps the heart of [Orsi's] genius for writing about religion lies in his deft balance of the individual person and the encompassing dynamics of national and international history...Many, I suspect, will applaud Orsi&#x2019;s effort at pushing back on the epistemological presumptions of modernity, in part at least because doing so opens the way for a fuller recognition of materiality, of the troubling bodies and substances, images, and efficacious things that act on devotees with a force to be reckoned.

This seamless blend of dramatic biography and mathematical documentary links the personal with the scientific. For example, Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli, whose hydrodynamic equation led ultimately to the airplane, quit mathematics in disgust with his seemingly pointless career after his jealous father plagiarized his fluid-flow equations. Isaac Newton, whose understanding of gravitational attraction between objects made possible the landing of a human on the moon, was impelled to high achievement partly by an obsessive desire for vindication and revenge against a classroom bully. German physicist Rudolf Clausius, whose wife, Adelheid, died giving birth in 1875, saw life as an ultimately futile contest for survival; his law of entropy, or irreversible energy dissipation, explains a universe in which everything?cells, organisms, galaxies?eventually ages and dies. Also here are British chemist Michael Faraday, father of the electrical age, and Albert Einstein, who rued his decision to encourage Roosevelt to build atomic bombs. A wholly accessible, beautifully written exploration of the potent mathematical imagination. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Take one part each of natural philosophy, biography, and historical novel, mix together, and you have this adventure through two centuries of changing scientific thought. Guillen chooses Newton's universal law of gravitation, Bernoulli's law of fluid flow pressure, Faraday's law relating electricity and magnetism, Clausius' law of constantly increasing entropy, and Einstein's law relating mass and energy, and in each instance discusses the common beliefs (often dominated by religious thinking) of the time, follows that with a short account of the scientist and his discovery, and ends by considering the effect of the discovery on the future. Newton's inquiry leads to a heliocentric solar system and to space travel, Faraday's to the generation of electricity and the electric motor, Bernoulli's to the airplane, etc. Far from being dauntingly technical, Guillen's presentations show how each man overcame significant obstacles and changed the world. He is a good storyteller who will enlighten many about aspects of these five equations that even many an erstwhile engineering student does not know. <i>Alan Hirsch</i></p><h2>Introduction to Logic 7ED</h2><p>Easy-to-read, visually appealing, and chock full of real-world applications, this most complete and authoritative book on introductory logic fully prepares users to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic&#x2014;explaining all concepts and techniques clearly, accurately, and thoroughly, and bringing them to life using a wealth of real-life examples of lively arguments and explanations drawn from a wide variety of sources to help demonstrate the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems in a wide range of fields.

For anyone searching for a top-notch, easy-to-understand introduction to logic.</p><p>Copi and Cohen&#39;s Introduction to Logic, Ninth Edition, is by far the most complete treatment of introductory logic, both deductive and inductive, both classical and modern. It is the standard text in logic today--the paradigm of clarity and accuracy. This text enables all students to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic. Lively argumentative excerpts from politics, philosophy, science, and contemporary controversies bring substance and life to the study of logic--demonstrating the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems. Arguments excerpted as illustrations and as exercise material include examples of fallacies to show students how arguments go wrong when logical principles are ignored or misapplied. A few examples of argumentative reasoning were constructed for the book to demonstrate principles; however, it is the wealth of current, up-to-date examples selected from actual texts representing many fields of interest that set this book apart.<p> Many changes will be found in this new edition of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> but instructors who have used previous editions may be assured that the integrity and spirit of this book have been retained. Much of the detail of previous editions and most of the exercises also have been retained. The changes introduced&#x2014;of five different kinds&#x2014;are designed to make this well-tested volume more accessible, and thus more effective as an instrument in the teaching of elementary logic. We recount these changes briefly here, addressing this report mainly to those acquainted with previous editions. </p> <p><b><i>A Revised Chapter 1.</i></b></p> <p> Structural changes have been made in the first part of the book. The expansion of the opening chapters in the preceding edition was found by many users to hinder student progress along what may be called "the main line" of instruction in logic. We have therefore compressed the material of what was Part One into a single opening chapter in which the same topics are addressed, but more crisply, and in ways likely to provide a better base for the more advanced material in the later chapters of the book. Chapter 1 has now become very hefty as a result&#x2014;but it is also richer, more clearly formulated, and more fun to read. </p> <p><b><i>Exposition-Rules and Definitions.</i></b></p> <p> The most pervasive of the changes in this edition, and most important too, we think, are the very many adjustments in the ways in which theoretical matters are explained and expressed. We have long prided ourselves on the logical accuracy of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> and of course we would do nothing to injure our hard-earned reputation for reliability. But our colleagues around the country have advised us, on many occasions, that our efforts to be exact, and to cut no corners, have in some parts of the book resulted in formulations rather difficult to digest&#x2014;especially for beginning students. </p> <p> This is not an easy matter to address. We have worked hard to ameliorate this problem&#x2014;and if we have succeeded in this edition many of the resultant changes will be hardly noticeable. Explanations should be formulated in language that is transparent and thoroughly perspicuous, and (we hope) that will cause few brows to wrinkle. </p> <p> Some illustrations of the kind of changes we have made are worth noting. Several of our colleagues observed that, where a set of rules or criteria have been put forward (as, for example, those to test the validity of categorical syllogisms, or to appraise the merit of analogical arguments), our exposition relied too heavily, in referring to a rule, upon the number assigned to it rather than to the substance of the rule itself. We have reformulated such exposition, consistently referring now to the rule itself. </p> <p> Another example of reformulation will be noted in the chapter on definition. Previously, in explaining methods of defining, we caused needless confusion by using that much misunderstood word "connotation." The terms "connotation" and "denotation" were not employed erroneously, but to avoid confusion, we now rely fully upon the terms "intension" and "extension" in explaining techniques of definition. </p> <p> Even format can serve to confuse, or to clarify. It was and remains our practice, in presenting deductive exercises in symbols, to mark the conclusion of an argument with the three triangular dots (.-.) that commonly represent "therefore." But in earlier editions we had sometimes placed this sign on the same line as the last premise of the argument, after a slash; and sometimes we had placed this sign on a separate line of its own. This proved to be a source of distraction if not confusion, so we now consistently place the three-dot "therefore" sign of conclusion on a separate line. This format enables students to see more sharply the claim that the argument is making, and what the target of a needed proof must be. </p> <p> Many such adjustments appear in this edition, far too many to permit their identification in this Preface. In some cases the change is no more than the clarification of a transition, in others the tightening of a paragraph in which the prose was blurred. A textbook in logic ought to be concise, but it must also be precise; precision and clarity we have prized above all. </p> <p> Along with such adjustments we have sought, where feasible, to strike a lighter and more friendly tone in this edition, to introduce illustrations or observations that may amuse as they instruct. The study of logic is sometimes laborious, but it need not be forbidding. </p> <p><b><i>Sidebars.</i></b></p> <p> Those who study logic with the help of this book differ very greatly in the range of their interests and in the degree of their preparation. We will not be satisfied if we fail to challenge those who are most well prepared and most acute; but those coming to systematic logic for the first time also deserve support and guidance appropriate for them. To this end, we have introduced a device that is wholly new to <i>Introduction to Logic:</i> We have sought to distinguish some portions in some chapters that may, for good reasons, be omitted in some learning contexts, or may be treated by instructors as tangential to "the main line." These portions can serve to challenge some students who feel ready for additional work. </p> <p> Finding a way to do this without injury to the whole is problematic. We have adopted the simple device of a sidebar. These sidebars take two forms, "Advanced Material" and "For Enrichment." We emphasize that this contrivance is not meant to depreciate the passages so marked off, which are often especially interesting and demanding. But such sidebar material, we hope, will make it easier for instructors to guide their own students to a mastery of the elements of theory most critical for them&#x2014;and perhaps to avoid some complexities not essential for their solid grasp of elementary logic. Many instructors will simply ignore these markings, and may do so without damage to the understanding of their students. </p> <p><b><i>Technical Changes.</i></b></p> <p> Some technical changes have been introduced into this edition of <i>Introduction to Logic</i>&#x2014;changes that we think reduce ambiguity and thus support instruction. </p> <p> For example, we have responded to the frequently expressed concern of colleagues by expanding the discussion of logical equivalence in Chapter 8, now more sharply emphasizing the differences between material equivalence as a truth-functional connective, and logical equivalence as a logical relation that justifies the rules of replacement. An entirely new section on this topic (section 8.6) has been inserted, and in this section we have introduced a new symbol for logical equivalence as well. </p> <p> In earlier editions we allowed the equivalences expressed by the rules of replacement&#x2014;the last 10 of the 19 Rules of Inference&#x2014;to be symbolized by the same three-bar symbol with which material equivalence ("if and only if") is symbolized throughout. This practice had some justification, but it surely led to student confusion when, for example, rules of replacement were formulated in which the three-bar symbol appeared more than once, with more than one meaning. A distinct symbol was needed. </p> <p> Selecting that symbol has been a matter of long-continuing deliberation. Many alternatives were considered and rejected for reasons pedagogical or theoretical or aesthetic. We have chosen to retain the three-bar symbol, <i>over</i> which a small T indicates that the equivalence confronted is a tautology. This achieves the teaching aim, we think, with a minimum of disruption. Students are rarely called upon to write the symbol for logical equivalence&#x2014;but can (with this notation) recognize it unambiguously when it appears in the list of he rules of replacement that natural deduction employs. </p> <p> Elsewhere in the treatment of deduction, we have changed the design of Venn diagrams in representing Categorical Syllogisms. Where previously we had used simple shading to mark off what the premises of the argument rule out, we have in this edition used slanted lines. This permits the impact of each of the two premises of a syllogism to be distinguished, and because their lines are slanted in opposite directions, a cross-hatching results when the logical impacts of the two premises overlap. Different colors we chose not to use, not wanting to convey the suggestion that students would need anything more than an ordinary pencil to employ Venn diagrams for themselves. </p> <p><b><i>Revised Exercises.</i></b></p> <p> Finally, exercise sets provided at the close of many sections have been enriched. Many exercises have been added, some removed. As in previous editions of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> we have sought to provide a wide array of illustrative passages, where possible on controversial issues likely to be of genuine interest to college students. Some contrived exercises are still used, or course, but we take pride in the fact that the exercises are for the most part extracted from worthy books and periodicals of very great variety.

What if she then tells you that her body is actually in a coma on the other side of town? Should you have her see a psychiatrist or should you consult one yourself? Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure? This is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment. Arthur is the only man who can share Lauren&#39;s secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence. So when doctors prepare to end Lauren&#39;s physical care -- which would destroy the magical bond she and Arthur cherish -- he must find a way to save her. For, after all, it is only her love that can save him. If Only It Were True is a heartwarming love story impossible to forget, an adventure that is by turns breathtaking and hilarious -- a captivating tale that evokes the essence of romance and our boundless capacity to believe.</p><p><b>Marc Levy</b> lived in San Francisco for six years before returning to France to run an architectural firm. He divides his time between America and Europe. <i>Just Like Heaven</i> is his first novel and was an instant #1 bestseller in his homeland. Foreign rights have been sold in twenty-eight countries.An unforgettable, heart-warming love story, read with clarity and warmth, touches the heart and fascinates the listener from beginning to end. The elements of mystery and romance are developed, detail by captivating detail, as Michael McGlone tells the story of Lauren, a medical resident in a deep coma. Lauren's spirit resides as a houseguest in her former home with the new purchaser, Arthur, the only one who can see and talk to her. The story is paced well, except in the middle where too much childhood detail is added. Not just a romance, but also a good story, this is well worth taking from the shelf.

Ann began by studying pharmacology, and in 1934, received her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of Connecticut College of Pharmacy. She worked as a registered pharmacist in Old Saybrook and in Lyme, and during these years wrote several short stories. When she married George David Petry in 1938, the course of her life changed. They lived in New York City, and Ann went to work for the Harlem Amsterdam News. By 1941, she was covering general news stories and editing the women&#39;s pages of the People&#39;s Voice in Harlem. Her first published story appeared in 1943 in the Crisis, a magazine published monthly by the NAACP. Subsequent to that, she began work on her first novel, The Street, which was published in 1946 and for which she received the Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship. Mrs. Petry has written two more novels, The Country Place and The Narrows, and numerous short stories, articles and children&#39;s books. In addition, she was appointed visiting professor of English at the University of Hawaii (1944 - 45) and has lectured widely throughout the United States. Ann returned with her husband to Old Saybrook in 1947 and lived there until here death. They have one daughter.Ann Petry puts forth a painfully honest treatise on black/white relations in <b>The Street</b>, and while it was written nearly fifty years ago, her unblinking insights and powerful commentary on the dynamics of race in the United States remain accurate today. Lutie Johnson, an intelligent, strong, and beautiful black woman, is the vehicle for Ann Petry's message. Separated from her husband, Lutie is doing her best to raise an eight-year-old son, achieve independence from her father, advance in her job, and work her way out of the Harlem streets, which she calls "The North's lynch mobs ... the method the big cities use to keep Negroes in their place." Streetwise, she is able to avoid being conned and to exploit a con artist to get ahead. Though her self-knowledge is thorough, it can't stop her entanglement in a tradition of oppression and an upbringing which blames whites for present afflictions. Her goals and values are her strength, enabling her to make decisions when there is no apparent choice and to face a justice system fraught with injustice. She ultimately escapes, but not without a sacrifice that rips apart any woman's heart. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Suzanne Leslie Simmons</i></p><h2>Choral Music: History, Style And Performance Practice</h2><p><p> <b> </b>Takes the reader through an enlightening tour of choral music, emphasizing on the musical style performance practice of different historical periods. <b> </b>The reference provides guidelines on the numerous aspects of performance practice for choral music based on the Renaissance Period, the Baroque Period, the Classical period, the Romantic period, and the Modern Period, with special emphasis on meter and stress, tempo, dynamics, tone quality, pitch, texture, and expressive aspects of the music of each period. <b> </b>Appropriate for Junior/Graduate-level courses in Choral Conducting and Literature.. </p></p><p>Comprehensive and authoritative, this text provides guidelines on numerous aspects of performance practice for choral music from different historical periods -- Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods.</p><h2>Image Grammar : Using Grammatical Structures to Teach Writing(Bk &amp; Cdrom)</h2><p>For decades, scholars have urged teachers to integrate grammar and writing, yet few have provided teachers with enough strategies and materials to do so.

Now, in volume 2, he examines these relations in fiction and theories of literature.<br> <br> Ricoeur treats the question of just how far the Aristotelian concept of "plot" in narrative fiction can be expanded and whether there is a point at which narrative fiction as a literary form not only blurs at the edges but ceases to exist at all. Though some semiotic theorists have proposed all fiction can be reduced to an atemporal structure, Ricoeur argues that fiction depends on the reader's understanding of narrative traditions, which do evolve but necessarily include a temporal dimension. He looks at how time is actually expressed in narrative fiction, particularly through use of tenses, point of view, and voice. He applies this approach to three books that are, in a sense, tales about time: Virgina Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway;</i> Thomas Mann's <i>Magic Mountain;</i> and Marcel Proust's <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>.<br> <br> "Ricoeur writes the best kind of philosophy&#x2014;critical, economical, and clear."&#x2014;Eugen Weber, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br> <br> "A major work of literary theory and criticism under the aegis of philosophical hermenutics.

Exciting and entertaining, Buck's story is also intelligent and thought provoking - a story for all ages.</p><p>Jack London, whose real name was John Griffith Chaney, was born 12th January 1876 in San Francisco, America.<br>A resounding theme in his literary work was one of a struggle to survive. London's upbringing and his experiences in later life would serve as the grounding for his unique style of writing.<br>Although deserted by his father, London was raised by his spiritualist mother who was known for her eccentricity. By the age of 14, London was developing a taste for adventure and he left school to work for a government fish patrol. He would later join the navy, and would explore most of America by travelling as a hobo on freight trains.<br>In 1897 Jack London travelled to the Klondike hoping to strike it rich in America's last gold rush. While he did not find gold in the harsh arctic wilderness, London did discover a wealth of material he would later fashion into two of his best known novels, Call of the Wild and White Fang.<br>Published in 1903, Call of the Wild benefited from the rise of the modern press and publishing industry, becoming immensely popular and launching London's career. Over the following years London wrote prolifically, drawing again on his Klondike adventure for White Fang and his experiences at sea as a young man for The Sea Wolf. <br>London died on 22nd November 1916."A top-notch graphic adaptation of one of my favorite classic novels.

Marshall served his country as an officer, Congressman, diplomat, and Secretary of State before President John Adams named him the nation's fourth Chief Justice, the longest-serving in American history. Marshall transformed the Supreme Court from an irrelevant appeals court into a powerful branch of government&#x2014;and provoked the ire of thousands of Americans who, like millions today, accused him and the court of issuing decisions that were tantamount to new laws and Constitutional amendments.<br><br>And the Court's critics were right! Marshall admitted as much.<br><br>With nine decisions that shocked the nation, John Marshall and his court assumed powers to strike down laws it deemed unconstitutional. In doing so, Marshall's court acted without Constitutional authority, but its decisions saved American liberty by protecting individual rights and the rights of private business against tyranny by federal, state, and local government.<br></p><p>An acclaimed historian, <b>Harlow Giles Unger</b> is a former Distinguished Visiting Fellow at George Washington's Mount Vernon.

He shines a bright light on the men we call Founders Unger's biography is also a fascinating history of the turbulent times in which Marshall lived This is an extensively researched biography of a man who is too little remembered today. It's become a clichï¿½ to say that a book reads like a novel, but that doesn't make it any less true.

As he unfolds Marshall's personal life, his career at law and his service as chief justice, Unger also provides a concise tale of the birth of the United States as a unified country under the Constitution. This biography serves the dual purpose of explaining Marshall's critical role in saving the nation from chaos while giving a concise account of the social and political forces at play during the nation's salad days In telling the story of Marshall, Unger provides keen insight into the very foundation of the United States of America and an excellent introduction to the United States Constitution and the Supreme Court, especially for those who want to know the story without having to read volumes of case law and sometimes arcane exegetical texts.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Library Journal</i>, 10/1/14</b><br> Unger is very familiar with the founding fathers His research is heavy on primary sources Those interested in the founding fathers will appreciate this scholarly, accessible title.&#x201d;<br><br><br><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, 8/1/14</b><br> A cradle-to-grave biography of the U.S. Supreme Court's longest-serving chief justice Unger chooses to present all aspects of Marshall's life, including his military heroism and his extraordinary devotion to a chronically ill wife and their children It is well-researched, and the author is skilled at portraying the characters and viewpoints of Marshall's political friends and foes. Thomas Jefferson comes across as a stubborn, politically motivated and sometimes hypocritical man, and Unger employs the Marshall-Jefferson enmity effectively, adding tension to the narrative. <b>A vigorous account of an influential American life.</b>&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>New York Post</i>, 7/17/14</b><br> Read.

In 1958, Hollywood adapted the novel for the big screen starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.<i> The New York Times</i>said of the novel, "If ever a book had a ring of reality, this is it . . . combat passages rank with the most exciting written about any branch of the service."<i> The Saturday Review</i> called the book "a classic," and many reviewers compared its author to such greats as C. S. Forester and Erich Remarque. Today these accolades still ring true for Edward L. Beach's gripping first novel of American submariners confronting a formidable Japanese navy in a vicious battle to control the Pacific. Beach's taut and dramatic narrative, told with the intimacy of a confession, deals with two strong-headed men, Edward Richardson, the commander of the USS <i>Walrus</i>, and his executive officer, Jim Bledsoe. Bound together by wartime duty, the two are divided by jealousy, pride, and love for a beautiful woman. But long after the details of this famous novel fade from memory, what remains with us is a startling realization of the way it was, really was, in the silent service during World War II.<p>Unlike many war novels, here is a story that deals with war from the perspective of command. With fidelity, Beach creates the anguish, agony, and triumphs of command decisions. Commander Richardson embodies all that is fine and human in an excellent naval officer. This is a monument, not to the misfits and the mistakes, but to those men who rose to greatness under the sometimes unbearable tensions of action.</p></p><p>Edward L. Beach (1918-2002) graduated from the U. S. Naval Academy in 1939 and became a decorated submariner and best-selling author.</p><h2>The Gentleman&#39;s Daughter: Women&#39;s Lives in Georgian England (Yale Nota Bene)</h2><p>What was the life of an eighteenth-century British genteel woman like? In this lively and controversial book, Amanda Vickery invokes women&#x2019;s own accounts of their intimate and their public lives to argue that in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the scope of female experience did not diminish&#x2015;in fact, quite the reverse. Refuting the common understanding that in Georgian times the daughters of merchants, the wives of lawyers, and the sisters of gentlemen lost female freedoms and retreated into their homes, Vickery shows that these women experienced expanding social and intellectual horizons. As they embraced a world far beyond the boundaries of their own parishes through their tireless writing and ravenous reading, genteel women also enjoyed an array of emerging new public arenas&#x2015;assembly rooms, concert series, theater seasons, circulating libraries, day-time lectures, urban walks, and pleasure gardens.<br><br>Based on the letters, diaries, and account books of over one hundred women from commercial, professional, and gentry families, this book transforms our understanding of the position of women in Georgian England. In their own words, they tell of their sometimes humorous, sometimes moving experiences and desires, and of their many roles, including kinswoman, wife, mother, housekeeper, consumer, hostess, and member of polite society. By the nineteenth century, family duties continued to dominate women&#x2019;s lives, yet, Vickery contends, the public profile of privileged women had reached unprecedented heights.</p><p>Winner of the Longman <i>History Today</i> Prize in 1998, Amanda Vickery's <i>The Gentleman's Daughter: Women's Lives in Georgian England</i> is an outstanding study of a crucial period in modern women's history. Roy Porter described this book as "the most important thing in English feminist history in the last ten years." Readers familiar with the feminist analysis of women's lives in the late 18th to mid-19th century will find some of the commonplaces of that viewpoint called into question: the rise of "separate spheres" of male and female experience, for example, or the social construction of motherhood in the 18th century. At once scholarly and readable, <i>The Gentleman's Daughter</i> takes its readers on a vivid and well-illustrated tour of "genteel" Georgian society, bringing that world to life through what Vickery identifies as the "terms set out in their own letters by genteel women." Those terms structure the seven sections of the book: "Gentility", "Love and Duty', "Fortitude and Resignation" (which includes a notable discussion of the experience of pregnancy), "Prudent Economy", "Elegance", "Civility and Vulgarity", and "Propriety". "Our battles were not necessarily theirs," Vickery reminds us, striking her convincing balance between a feminist interest in the restriction and rebellion of women's lives and their own ways of finding meaning and pleasure in the gender distinctions of Georgian culture. <i>--Vicky Lebeau, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>Amanda Vickery</b> is lecturer in modern British women&#x2019;s history at Royal Hollowly College, University of London.</p><h2>Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 5 Student Textbook</h2><p>Introduce students to real science with Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 5 Student Textbook.

But the forest is gradually emptying as more and more people leave to settle in villages, where they break their backs tilling the land to grow wheat for their bread&#x201d; (which Leemet has been told tastes horrible) and where they pray to a god very different from the spirits worshipped in the forest&#x2019;s sacred grove. With lothario bears who wordlessly seduce women, a giant louse with a penchant for swimming, a legendary flying frog, and a young charismatic viper named Ints, <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish</i> is a totally inventive novel for readers of David Mitchell, Sjï¿½n, and Terry Pratchett.</p><p>Andrus Kivirahk is one of Estonia's most highly regarded contemporary writers. A journalist by profession, he is known for his satirical newspaper columns and his bestselling novels.

It&#x2019;s a yarn in every sense of the word a bit <i>Tin Drum</i>, a little <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, and with a cast of talking snakes, bears, lice, and primates, more than a little <i>Watership Down</i> . . . The novel shines . . . Readers who are charmed by the world Kivirï¿½hk creates here, by the imaginative breadth and offbeat characters, will be satisfied just inhabiting this world for 450 pages. Credit is due, too, to the translator and editor, who have made the English feel consistently natural, readable, authentic.&#x201d;<b> <i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><br> This translated Estonian treasure follows the adventures of a boy who is the last remaining speaker of Snakish, an ancient language by which he can command any animal.&#x201d;<b> <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br> This delightful Estonian novel coils and springs with a mix of dark humour, satire and allegorical observation . . . [an] intriguing story . . . a thought-provoking tale . . . The author&#x2019;s skill for social criticism and his literary talents are evident in <i>Snakish</i>, and he clearly has a gift for creating suspenseful, provocative stories . . . <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish</i> is wonderful don&#x2019;t let it slither away.&#x201d;<b> <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i></b><br><br> Epic, fantastical . . . Most astonishing is the inventive imagery, from lice crossbred large enough to be ridden by people to a legless flying savior who swoops across the cold sea to bludgeon knights and monks . . . Kivirï¿½hk&#x2019;s well-plotted story of language, loss, and fanaticism speaks powerfully to our world&#x2019;s ever present conflicts.&#x201d;<b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> Lots of fun here, with seductive bears, flying frogs, and a viper named Ints, but Kivirï¿½hk is also concerned with the dangers of war, colonization (particularly Christianity&#x2019;s breakdown of traditional belief), and idealizing the past. A big bestseller in Europe, with that ever-popular medieval/fantastical setting.&#x201d;<b> <i>Library Journal</i></b> <br><br> This allegorical story spins an element of wistful longing for anyone who has struggled between the old and the new, its lessons as relevant today as ever.&#x201d;<b> <i>Booklist</i></b><br><br> <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish</i> interrogates not only the literary logic of the allegorical mode but also the relationship we have as individuals and as readers to the dueling lures of tradition and change . . . a kind of bucolic Bildungsroman . . . Kivirï¿½hk provides a compelling and creaturely backdrop for the warring facets of Leemet&#x2019;s coming-of-age, characters who embody aspects of the distant past, the painful present, and the dangerous future . . . I felt compelled to continue reading in the certain knowledge that I&#x2019;d soon stumble upon a scene of great power and beauty or an elegantly aphoristic turn of phrase. Though presumably set hundreds of years before our own time, Leemet&#x2019;s struggle remains something of a microcosm of our own.&#x201d;<b> Words Without Borders</b><br><br> <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish</i> has the feeling of a folktale . . . This isn&#x2019;t to say that it&#x2019;s a work of light fantasy, however like Margo Lanagan&#x2019;s 2008 <i>Tender Morsels</i>, there&#x2019;s an undercurrent of violence that keeps the more mirthful aspects at a distance.&#x201d;<b> Literary Hub</b><br><br> This novel slithers along like the snakes it so admires, agile and often unexpectedly compelling . . . its irreverence for convention flows charmingly from its conversational prose . . . Readable and engaging, it&#x2019;s easy to see how this novel could become the delight of a nation.&#x201d;<b> Full Stop</b><br><br> [A] tumultuous Tolkien-like epic set in early medieval Estonia, where forces of modernity and tradition clash in a primeval struggle for the Baltic nation&#x2019;s soul and it&#x2019;s future . . . At its essence, this book is a Bildungsroman, a coming of age saga about a young man reconciling with a world experiencing seismic change . . . A strange, wondrous book.&#x201d;<b> <i>Toronto Star</i></b><br><br> Kivirï¿½hk&#x2019;s writing, delicate and forthright, childlike and sarcastic all at the same time, pokes fun at all forms of grandiosity, and is given depth by his staggering imagination, his great appetite, and his always reck less attitude. How to describe the book? Imagine it is the end of the world, and Tolkien, Beckett, Mark Twain, and Miyazaki (with Icelandic sagas and Asterix comic books stuffed under their arms) have got together in a cabin to drink and tell stories around the last bonfire the world will ever see.&#x201d;<b> <i>Le Magazine Littï¿½raire</i></b><br><br> The first great talent of this young Estonian author is to make us laugh about complex subjects . . . everything is of a remarkable clarity and immediacy, as if we had learned to speak snakish without realizing it. . . . The sense of humor and the imagery resembles a graphic novel or animated film. . . . Probably one of the best contemporary novels about what it means to be alone. . . . Marvelous in all senses of the word.&#x201d;<b> <i>Le Monde</i></b><br><br> Somewhere near the realms of fantasy and science fiction there exists a much more thrilling and allegorical form of writing, bending the rules of the genre to suit itself: Atwood&#x2019;s admonitory novels, Vonnegut&#x2019;s attempts to reach outside the bounds of reality and time, Bradbury&#x2019;s philosophical allegory encased within a science-fiction story, and so on. <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish</i> is an allegory about fading eras and vanishing worlds, and laced with a good dose of black humor to boot.&#x201d;<b> Jï¿½rgen Rooste, Estonian cultural critic</b><br><br>"The irreverent and funny Estonian writer Andrus Kivirï¿½hk has written an incredible novel, a mystifying treasure of a book. It will give you a raging desire to visit his home country. Is it a pseudo-fairytale in which animals and humans do not just talk to each other, but build great friendships and even romances or a liturgical lampoon rewritten by a naturalist undergoing a crisis of faith? We can&#x2019;t say for sure. The only course of action is to follow in the steps of Leemet, the hero of this adventure story, a young man who has mastered the language of snakes.&#x201d;<b> <i>Psychologies Magazine</i></b><br><br>"Kivirï¿½hk has taken care to remove from his text every specific chronological or geographical reference, which gives his book the character of a fable, something timeless. In a way that is totally fascinating, he throws a light on the Estonian world for the reader who is ignorant of that country&#x2019;s particular historical context. <i>The Man Who Spoke Snakish is a great novel</i>, one of those important books that speaks to your soul in its own language and which marks a milestone on your personal reading history and in the development of your opinions.&#x201d;<b> Blog des Bouquins</b><br><br>"A novel in which there is no downtime and which is great fun to read . . . a tragic and deeply political work, but one in which shards of laughter await on every page . . . It is good, it is beautiful, you will read it in one sitting, it radiates intelligence, it&#x2019;s a novel that since 2007 has been a smash hit in Estonia and has even been elevated to the ranks of the classics by a whole generation there. It is a true literary miracle thanks to which you may find yourself looking up at the sky in the hope of seeing the apocalyptic flight of the mythical Frog of the North.&#x201d;<b> L&#x2019;Ivre de Lire</b> <br><br>"This novel is totally unusual; it has the same strangeness as <i>La Locura de Dios</i> by Juan Miguel Aguilera or <i>Cold Skin</i> by Albert Sanchez Piï¿½ol. The author talks about Estonia (his country) in the 13th century, when iron men&#x201d; invaded the country on a crusade. It jumps between philosophical fable, political pamphlet, and Nordic saga, by way of some epic outbursts of violence.&#x201d;<b> Decitre.fr</b></p><h2>Adolescent Psychology, 6th Edition (Annual Editions)</h2><p>This Sixth Edition of ANNUAL EDITIONS: ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY provides convenient, inexpensive access to current articles selected from the best of the public press.

Critics have compared his work to such diverse artists as Kafka, Goya, Swift, Klee, and Beckett. Allen Ginsberg called Michaux &#x201c;genius,&#x201d; and Jorge Luis Borges wrote that Michaux&#x2019;s work &#x201c;is without equal in the literature of our time.&#x201d; This anthology contains substantial selections from almost all of Michaux&#x2019;s major works, most never before published in English, and allows readers to explore the haunting verbal and pictorial landscape of a twentieth-century visionary.</p><p>French painter Michaux (1899-1984) explored the subconscious mind and the effects of such hallucinogens as mescalin not only in pigment but in poetry. Here, poet Ball offers a generous and delightful selection from Michaux's published works; his translation skills bring Michaux's words to life in English, giving them the same energy and nimbleness they have in their original French. Many of the works in this anthology are prose poems, but this is essentially a collection of verse, one that requires continual reading the way a bag of peanuts requires continual eating. Observations on human interactions, as well as the life of the mind, abound. Highly recommended for most public and academic libraries; this poetry should have wide appeal. (Photos not seen.)-Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.&#34;David Ball has assembled and translated a stunning selection of Michaux&#39;s works. . . .

While retaining the strengths that have made prior editions much adopted around the world, the seventh edition has been updated to weave in such important new topics as the impact of the recent global financial crisis, the global smartphone infrastructure, climate change, corporate social responsibility, and national and international inequality. Readable case studies and excellent figures and graphs provide students with the empirical illustrations they need to understand the larger theoretical concepts. A remarkable update by the foremost economic geographer of globalization that should be on everyone's reading list."--Martin Kenney, PhD, Department of Human Ecology, University of California, Davis; Senior Project Director, Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy<br><br> "<i>Global Shift, Seventh Edition</i>, continues to be a key resource for understanding the complexity of the global economy and the ongoing, often contentious negotiations among nations, corporations, and locales. In addition to clearly outlining larger institutional and structural processes, Dicken provides a wealth of detailed new empirical material to explain how the outcomes of the global economy manifest in specific contexts. The book's diverse concrete examples--such as the global production network of iPhones or corporate strategies to shield profits from taxation--are drawn directly from the headlines. An extremely valuable text for all courses on economic geography, globalization, international business, and economics."--Matthew Zook, PhD, Department of Geography, University of Kentucky<br><br> "Given the dizzying pace of change in the global economy, it's more important than ever to have a comprehensive point of reference to allow us to understand and map the transformations around us. <i>Global Shift, Seventh Edition</i>, is that book. While continuing to add new material on countries, sectors, and the policies that shape global industries, <i>Global Shift </i>also provides a solid analytical framework that helps the reader navigate the new terrain. And its great graphs, diagrams, and charts are a visual delight. If you had to use just one book to convey globalization's promise and perils, this is the book I would recommend."--Gary Gereffi, PhD, Department of Sociology and Center on Globalization, Governance and Competitiveness, Duke University<br><br> "Not just an update, the seventh edition of <i>Global Shift</i> offers compelling theoretical and empirical insights as it takes on the critical global political-economic processes and debates of our time.

An amazing resource."--Erica Schoenberger, PhD, Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University<br><br> "<i>Global Shift</i> defines the gold standard in the field of globalization studies, which it has had a large hand in defining. The revised seventh edition continues to accomplish what no other book in the field does--it presents a grounded but broad view of globalization, judiciously assesses the key debates, and recognizes (but never drowns in) complexity. <i>Global Shift</i> combines an authoritative voice with meticulous documentation and outstanding illustrations; it&#x2019;s the trusted source."--Jamie Peck, PhD, Canada Research Chair in Urban and Regional Political Economy, University of British Columbia, Canada<br><br> "I used this text in my undergraduate Global Apparel Industry Dynamics class. It is a valuable text that explains the critical components and dynamics of the global economy in a straightforward and engaging style that is accessible to undergraduates as well as graduates. Dicken provides important historical perspectives on the evolution of the global economy while keeping abreast of recent developments. Key industries are examined in a relevant manner, adding an extra dimension to the work. <i>Global Shift </i>will equip any young graduate/executive with important insights into the global characteristics of business environments."--Peter Kilduff, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Apparel Merchandising and Management, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona<br><br> "<i>Global Shift</i> has become the de facto textbook for middle- and upper-level courses in economic geography. Dicken synthesizes the economic, political, and social complexities of globalization in highly accessible prose. The case studies of various industries contribute to a better understanding of the processes of globalization."--Marc Vachon, PhD, Department of Geography, University of Winnipeg, Canada<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"This book, unlike much writing on globalization, is unequivocally interdisciplinary, giving it strength and depth of insight.

Douglas in an historic argument over the future of slavery in a westward-expanding America. Two years later, an equally historic oratorical showdown between secessionists and Unionists in Georgia generated as much popular interest south of the Mason-Dixon line, and perhaps had an even more profound immediate effect on the future of the United States.<br><br>With Abraham Lincoln's "Black Republican" triumph in the presidential election of 1860 came ardent secessionist sentiment in the South. But Unionists were equally zealous and while South Carolina--a bastion of Disunionism since 1832--seemed certain to secede; the other fourteen slave states were far from decided. In the deep South, the road to disunion depended much on the actions of Georgia, a veritable microcosm of the divided South and geographically in the middle of the Cotton South. If Georgia went for the Union, secessionist South Carolina could be isolated. So in November of 1860 all the eyes of Dixie turned to tiny Milledgeville, pre-war capital of Georgia, for a legislative confrontation that would help chart the course toward civil war.<br><br>In <em>Secession Debated</em>, William W. Freehling and Craig M. Simpson have for the first time collected the seven surviving speeches and public letters of this greatest of southern debates over disunion, providing today's reader with a unique window into a moment of American crisis. Introducing the debate and debaters in compelling fashion, the editors help bring to life a sleepy Southern town suddenly alive with importance as a divided legislature met to decide the fate of Georgia, and by extension, that of the nation. We hear myriad voices, among them the energetic and self-righteous governor Joseph E. Brown who, while a slaveholder and secessionist, was somewhat suspect as a native <em>North</em> Georgian; Alexander H. Stephens, the eloquent Unionist whose "calm dispassionate approach" ultimately backfired; and fiery secessionist Robert Toombs who, impatient with Brown's indecisiveness and the caution of the Unionists, shouted to legislators: "Give me the sword! but if you do not place it in my hands, before God! <em>I will take it</em>." The secessionists' Henry Benning and Thomas R.R. Cobb as well as the Unionists Benjamin Hill and Herschel Johnson also speak to us across the years, most with eloquence, all with the patriotic, passionate conviction that defined an era. In the end, the legislature adopted a convention bill which decreed a popular vote on the issue in early January, 1861. The election results were close, mirroring the intense debate of two months before: 51% of Georgians favored immediate secession, a slim margin which the propaganda-conscious Brown later inflated to 58%.

Founded by the printmakers Luï¿½s Arenal, Leopoldo Mï¿½ndez, and American-born Pablo O&#x2019;Higgins, the TGP ultimately became the most influential and enduring leftist printmaking collective of its time.&nbsp;<br> The workshop was admired for its prolific and varied output and for its creation of some of the most memorable images in midcentury printmaking. Although its core membership was Mexican, the TGP welcomed foreign members and guest artists as diverse as Josef Albers and Elizabeth Catlett. The collective enjoyed international influence and renown and inspired the establishment of similar print collectives around the world. This bilingual publication features twenty-four works representing the finest linocuts and lithographs from the heyday of this important workshop. These arresting images are drawn from the significant holdings of TGP works in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>This bilingual publication offers an account of the influential Mexican leftist printmaking collective Taller de Grï¿½fica Popular, which produced some of the most memorable printed images of the mid-20th century.<b>Diane Miliotes</b> is an independent art historian, curator, and educator based in Chicago.</p><h2>Fluency With Information Technology (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Fluency with Information Technology: Skills, Concepts, and Capabilities</i> </b> <i> is intended for use in the introduction to Computer Science course.

Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to get the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection of modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an individual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a single module in a larger one; or a software engineer, who may be part of a team developing a complex program comprised of many modules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for object-oriented program design and component-based software development from this methodology. </p> <p>Because each module in a program corresponds to an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine to search the collection for documents of interest, the book first explains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers: procedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data abstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the central paradigm in object-oriented program design and implementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how to develop informal specifications that define these abstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and then discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what they are supposed to do with acceptable performance. </p> <p>Other topics discussed include: </p> <ul> <li>Encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification </li><li>Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance </li><li>Techniques to help readers of code understand and reason about it, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction functions </li><li>Type hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data abstractions </li><li>Debugging, testing, and requirements analysis </li><li>Program design as a top-down, iterative process, and design patterns </li> </ul> <p>The Java programming language is used for the book's examples. However, the techniques presented are language independent, and an introduction to key Java concepts is included for programmers who may not be familiar with the language. </p></p><p>Constructing production-quality programs--programs that are used over an extended period of time--is well known to be extremely difficult. The goal of this book is to improve the effectiveness of programmers in carrying out this task. I hope the reader will become a better programmer as a result of reading the book. I believe the book succeeds at improving programming skills because my students tell me that it happens for them. What makes a good programmer? It is a matter of efficiency over the entire production of a program. The key is to reduce wasted effort at each stage. Things that can help include thinking through your implementation before you start coding, coding in a way that eliminates errors before you test, doing rigorous testing so that errors are found early, and paying careful attention to modularity so that when errors are discovered, they can be corrected with minimal impact on the program as a whole. This book covers techniques in all these areas. Modularity is the key to writing good programs. It is essential to break up a program into small modules, each of which interacts with the others through a narrow, well-defined interface. With modularity, an error in one part of a program can be corrected without having to consider all the rest of the code, and a part of the program can be understood without having to understand the entire thing. Without modularity, a program is a large collection of intricately interrelated parts. It is difficult to comprehend and to modify such a program, and also difficult to get it to work correctly.<p>The focus of this book therefore is on modular program construction: how to organize a program as a collection of well-chosen modules. The book relates modularity to abstraction. Each module corresponds to an abstraction, such as an index that keeps track of interesting words in a large collection of documents or a procedure that uses the index to find documents that match a particular query. Particular emphasis is placed on object-oriented programming--the use of data abstraction and objects in developing programs. The book uses Java for its programming examples. Familiarity with Java is not assumed. It is worth noting, however, that the concepts in this book are language independent and can be used to write programs in any programming language. How Can the Book Be Used? Program Development in Java can be used in two ways. The first is as the text for a course that focuses on an object-oriented methodology for the design and implementation of complex systems. The second is use by computing professionals who want to improve their programming skills and their knowledge of modular, object-oriented design.</p><p>When used as a text, the book is intended for a second or third programming course; we have used the book for many years in the second programming course at MIT, which is taken by sophomores and juniors. At this stage, students already know how to write small programs. The course builds on this material in two ways: by getting them to think more carefully about small programs, and by teaching them how to construct large programs using smaller ones as components. This book could also be used later in the curriculum, for example, in a software engineering course.</p><p>A course based on the book is suitable for all computer science majors. Even though many students will never be designers of truly large programs, they may work at development organizations where they will be responsible for the design and implementation of subsystems that must fit into the overall structure. The material on modular design is central to this kind of a task. It is equally important for those who take on larger design tasks. What Is This Book About? Roughly two-thirds of the book is devoted to the issues that arise in building individual program modules. The remainder of the book is concerned with how to use these modules to construct large programs.</p><p>Program Modules This part of the book focuses on abstraction mechanisms. It discusses procedures and exceptions, data abstraction, iteration abstraction, families of data abstractions, and polymorphic abstractions.</p><p>Three activities are emphasized in the discussion of abstractions. The first is deciding on exactly what the abstraction is: what behavior it is providing to its users. Inventing abstractions is a key part of design, and the book discusses how to choose among possible alternatives and what goes into inventing good abstractions.</p><p>The second activity is capturing the meaning of an abstraction by giving a specification for it. Without some description, an abstraction is too vague to be useful. The specification provides the needed description. This book defines a format for specifications, discusses the properties of a good specification, and provides many examples.</p><p>The third activity is implementing abstractions. The book discusses how to design an implementation and the trade-off between simplicity and performance. It emphasizes encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the behavior defined by the specification. It also presents techniques--in particular, the use of representation invariants and abstraction functions--that help readers of code to understand and reason about it. Both rep invariants and abstraction functions are implemented to the extent possible, which is useful for debugging and testing.</p><p>The material on type hierarchy focuses on its use as an abstraction technique--a way of grouping related data abstractions into families. An important issue here is whether it is appropriate to define one type to be a subtype of another. The book defines the {substitution principle}--a methodical way for deciding whether the subtype relation holds by examining the specifications of the subtype and the supertype.</p><p>This book also covers debugging and testing. It discusses how to come up with a sufficient number of test cases for thorough black box and glass box tests, and it emphasizes the importance of regression testing. Programming in the Large The latter part of Program Development in Java is concerned with how to design and implement large programs in a modular way. It builds on the material about abstractions and specifications covered in the earlier part of the book.</p><p>The material on programming in the large covers four main topics. The first concerns requirements analysis--how to develop an understanding of what is wanted of the program. The book discusses how to carry out requirements analysis and also describes a way of writing the resulting requirements specification, by making use of a {data model} that describes the abstract state of the program. Using the model leads to a more precise specification, and it also makes the requirements analysis more rigorous, resulting in a better understanding of the requirements.</p><p>The second programming in the large topic is program design, which is treated as an iterative process. The design process is organized around discovering useful abstractions, ones that can serve as desirable building blocks within the program as a whole. These abstractions are carefully specified during design so that when the program is implemented, the modules that implement the abstractions can be developed independently. The design is documented by a design notebook, which includes a module dependency diagram that describes the program structure.</p><p>The third topic is implementation and testing. The book discusses the need for design analysis prior to implementation and how design reviews can be carried out. It also discusses implementation and testing order. This section compares top-down and bottom-up organizations, discusses the use of drivers and stubs, and emphasizes the need to develop an ordering strategy prior to implementation that meets the needs of the development organization and its clients.</p><p>This book concludes with a chapter on design patterns. Some patterns are introduced in earlier chapters; for example, iteration abstraction is a major component of the methodology. The final chapter discusses patterns not covered earlier. It is intended as an introduction to this material. The interested reader can then go on to read more complete discussions contained in other books.

The famous New York district nurtured the aspirations of thousands of upwardly mobile Americans while the infamous gangsters of Murder, Incorporated controlled its streets. But during the 1960s, Brownsville was stigmatized as a black and Latino ghetto, a neighborhood with one of the city's highest crime rates. Home to the largest concentration of public housing units in the city, Brownsville came to be viewed as emblematic of urban decline. And yet, at the same time, the neighborhood still supported a wide variety of grass-roots movements for social change.<br> <br> The story of these two different, but in many ways similar, Brownsvilles is compellingly told in this probing new work. Focusing on the interaction of Brownsville residents with New York's political and institutional elites, Wendell Pritchett shows how the profound economic and social changes of post-World War II America affected the area. He covers a number of pivotal episodes in Brownsville's history as well: the rise and fall of interracial organizations, the struggles to deal with deteriorating housing, and the battles over local schools that culminated in the famous 1968 Teachers Strike. Far from just a cautionary tale of failed policies and institutional neglect, the story of Brownsville's transformation, he finds, is one of mutual struggle and frustrated cooperation among whites, blacks, and Latinos.<br> <br> Ultimately, <i>Brownsville, Brooklyn</i> reminds us how working-class neighborhoods have played, and continue to play, a central role in American history. It is a story that needs to be read by all those concerned with the many challenges facing America's cities today.</p></p><p><i>Brownsville, Brooklyn</i> traces the history of Brownsville, a section of Brooklyn, from its origins as a white, predominately Jewish, working-class neighborhood through its transformation in the 1960s into a black and Latino ghetto, a stigmatized neighborhood with one of the city's highest crime rates.

When the Tea Party became a leading symbol of the Revolutionary ear fifty years after the actual event, this &#34;common man&#34; in his nineties was &#34;discovered&#34; and celebrated in Boston as a national hero. Young pieces together this extraordinary tale, adding new insights about the role that individual and collective memory play in shaping our understanding of history.</p><p>On December 16, 1773, some 150 men boarded three ships docked at Griffin's Wharf. Dressed as Mohawks, their faces darkened with soot, the men cracked open chests of tea and threw them into Boston Harbor. What began as a protest against the duty on tea became an icon of the American Revolution. But what did the Boston Tea Party mean to its participants? Indeed, what did the Revolution mean to the ordinary person? In <i>The Shoemaker and the Tea Party</i>, Alfred F. Young tells the story of George Robert Twelves Hewes, who was involved in several events in Boston during the Revolution. In 1835, when Hewes was in his 90s, he was celebrated as one of the last survivors of the Tea Party.<p> <i>The Shoemaker and the Tea Party</i> comprises two linked essays. The first is about Hewes (whom Young describes as "a nobody who briefly became a somebody in the Revolution and, for a moment near the end of his life, a hero"), his memories, and what these memories reveal about the meaning of the Revolution for him. "For a moment he was on a level with his betters. So he thought at the time, and so it grew in his memory as it disappeared in his life." The second essay follows the lead of Michael Kammen and Eric Hobsbawm by looking at the dichotomies of public vs. private and popular vs. official memory, and the external forces that shape these memories into "tradition." Young does an excellent job of illustrating his theory with experiences from Hewes's life, newspaper accounts, and contemporary prints. This book will interest both scholars and general readers, though Young does presume some prior knowledge of the Revolution on the part of the reader. A thought-provoking look at the nature of memory, history, and tradition. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Alfred F.

This challenge&#x2014;issued by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels in <i>Critical Inquiry</i> (8:4)&#x2014;strikes some critics as scandalous, others as provocative and productive.<br> <br> The argument is directed against both sides of the current debates in literary theory, criticizing theoretical "objectivists" like E. D. Hirsch, Jr., on the one hand, and proponents of indeterminacy like Paul de Man on the other. The attack is not just on a particular way of doing theory but on the entire project of literary theory. The challenge is not only to a way of thinking and writing but to a way of making a living.<br> <br> The resulting controversy has drawn so much attention among literary critics that it has been collected in a single volume so that the debate can be followed from start to finish. This collection includes the essay "Against Theory," seven responses to it, and a rejoinder by Knapp and Michaels (originally published in <i>Critical Inquiry</i> 9:4); in addition, there are two new statements plus a final reply by Knapp and Michaels.<br> <br> The debate chronicled in this volume raises the most fundamental issues in the theory of meaning and the practice of interpretation. Are Knapp and Michaels confronting literary theory with a new "pragmatic" form of theory? Or are they (as some of their respondents suggest) arguing for a new form of nihilism? "If it is a nihilism," writes editor W. J. T. Mitchell, "it is one that demands an answer, not easy polemical dismissal, one that calls for theory to clarify its claims, not to mystify them and the easy assurance of intellectual fashion and institutional authority." It is the intention of <i>Against Theory</i> to aid in that clarification.</p></p><p><b>W. J. T.

Drawing on the CIA's extensive expertise, it shares all the basic information on equipment, ingredients, and techniques needed to become a great cook, from proper knife skills to cooking methods such as braising, grilling, saut?ing, and stewing.

The CIA, which also offers courses for industry professionals and food enthusiasts, has campuses in Hyde Park, New York; St. Helena, California; San Antonio, Texas; and Singapore<i>.</i></p>This superbly organized, stripped-down offspring of the CIA's <i>New Professional Chef</i> has the no-nonsense tone that results when dozens of teachers collaborate on a serious project: "Keep the blades of your knives sharp and well honed"; "Don't be tempted to leave the fish in the marinade for longer than 30 minutes." It's a refreshing sobriety amid the current mania for anecdotes in the home-cooking market. Less French than most school-driven texts, the book emphasizes basic techniques, from sautï¿½ing and roasting to portioning a chicken and making pasts. The recipe selections were edited with an equally heavy but sure hand: Puree of Split Pea, Roast Chicken with Pan Gravy, Beef Tenderloin with Wild Mushrooms, Gnocchi with Herbs and Butter. Each has an unobtrusive sidebar pointing out the relevant techniques (seeding tomatoes, melting chocolate). Even less familiar or more complex recipes - Roast Goose with Apple-Prune Sauce, Mole Poblano de Pollo, Steamed Cod with Gingered Hoisin Sauce - rely on sure-fire methods. Since pasta is a mainstay of home cooking, the carbonara-primavera-puttanesca trinity puts in an o bligatory appearance, along with various types of ravioli and lasagna. Desserts are mostly of the simple showstopper variety: Chocolate Mousse and several classic cooking-school soufflï¿½s. Look elsewhere, however, for game, sweetbreads, bread and pastry. Copiously photographed and filled with impressive-looking tables and charts (including 10 pages of weight/volume equivalents and temperature charts), this makes an ideal book for committed starting cooks, as well as culinary over-achievers who occasionally need reminding of the basics.

Each of the recipe chapters opens with more specia1ized techniques related to their subject The 200 recipes, many of them shown in color photographs, include both classic and more contemporary dishes.

He was so captivated by what he saw that he decided to devote his life to the glorification and preservation of this magnificent wilderness. <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>, whose heart is the diary Muir kept while tending sheep in Yosemite country, enticed thousands of Americans to visit this magical place, and resounds with Muir&#x2019;s regard for the &#x201c;divine, enduring, unwasteable wealth&#x201d; of the natural world. A classic of environmental literature, <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> continues to inspire readers to seek out such places for themselves and make them their own.</p><p>John Muir, a young Scottish immigrant, had not yet become the famed conservationist whom he liked to call "John o' the Mountains" when he first trekked into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada not long after the end of the Civil War. Having caught a glimpse of such magical places as Tuolumne Meadows and El Capitan, Muir ached to return, and in the summer of 1869 he signed on with a crew of shepherds and drove a flock of 2,500 woolly critters toward the headwaters of the Merced River.<p> The diary he kept while tending sheep forms the heart of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>; published in 1911, it enticed thousands of Americans to visit the Yosemite country. The book is full of the concerns Muir would later voice as America's foremost preservationist and wildlands advocate, which would bear fruit in the creation of several national parks and monuments. And it resounds with Muir's nearly pantheistic regard for the natural world: with celebrations of the Sierra's lizards that "dart about on the hot rocks, swift as dragonflies," its mountain lions and tall trees and fierce thunderstorms and bears; with Muir's overarching awe for places that civilization had yet to tame. Though perhaps a little purple by modern standards, Muir's book continues to inspire readers to seek out such places for themselves and make them their own--and as such it stands among the enduring classics of environmental literature. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#x201c;As more and more of us grow aghast at what we have done to the world we started with, Muir&#x2019;s reverence and devotion will seem keenly germane, and our regret may be transmuted into a fight for the future.&#x201d; &#x2014;Edward Hoagland</p><h2>The Divine Comedy: Inferno (Enriched Classics)</h2><p><b>ENDURING LITERATURE ILLUMINATED<br> BY PRACTICAL SCHOLARSHIP</b> <br><br> The first volume of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>--Dante begins his downward journey through the seven circles of Hell. <br><br> <b>EACH ENRICHED CLASSIC EDITION INCLUDES:</b> <br> ï¿½ A concise introduction that gives readers important background information <br> ï¿½ A chronology of the author's life and work <br> ï¿½ A timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context <br> ï¿½ An outline of key themes and plot points to help readers form their own interpretations <br> ï¿½ Detailed explanatory notes <br> ï¿½ Critical analysis, including contemporary and modern perspectives on the work <br> ï¿½ Discussion questions to promote lively classroom and book group interaction <br> ï¿½ A list of recommended related books and films to broaden the reader's experience <br><br> Enriched Classics offer readers affordable editions of great works of literature enhanced by helpful notes and insightful commentary.

And for over two thousand years, geometry has been equated with Euclid's <i>Elements</i>, arguably the most influential book in the history of mathematics In <i>The King of Infinite Space</i>, renowned mathematics writer David Berlinski provides a concise homage to this elusive mathematician and his staggering achievements. Berlinski shows that, for centuries, scientists and thinkers from Copernicus to Newton to Einstein have relied on Euclid's axiomatic system, a method of proof still taught in classrooms around the world. Euclid's use of elemental logic&#x2014;and the mathematical statements he and others built from it&#x2014;have dramatically expanded the frontiers of human knowledge.<br><br><i>The King of Infinite Space</i> presents a rich, accessible treatment of Euclid and his beautifully simple geometric system, which continues to shape the way we see the world.</p><p>David Berlinski holds a Ph.D. from Princeton University and has taught mathematics and philosophy at universities in the United States and France.

Its three-dimensional optics created a virtual presence for the viewer. Millions of Americans, especially schoolchildren, absorbed ideas about race, class, and gender from such 3D images, the embodiment of the notion that &#x201c;seeing is believing.&#x201d; Drawing on an enormous, rarely seen collection of some 300,000 stereographic views spanning the first decade of the twentieth century, Michael Lesy presents nearly 250 images displaying a riot of peoples and cultures, stark class divisions, and unsettling glimpses of daily life a century ago.</p><p>Like Lesy&#x2019;s landmark works of American macabre, <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> and <em>Murder City</em>, <em>Looking Backward</em> slides the reader into suspended animation. Haunting views of the early twentieth century&#x2019;s most significant events at home and in the farthest reaches of the world&#x2015;war, rebellion, industrial revolution, and natural catastrophe&#x2015;flank pictures of the last remnants of the premodern natural world. Lesy&#x2019;s evocative essays reassert the primacy of the stereograph in American visual history. He profiles the photographers who saw the world through their prejudices and the companies that sold their images everywhere. In underscoring the unnerving parallels between that period and our own, Looking Backward reveals a history that shadows us today.</p> 233 duotone photographs</p><p>Michael Lesy is one of America&#x2019;s leading photographic scholars.

Krick is the author of fourteen books on the American Civil War, including Stonewall Jackson at Cedar Mountain, winner of the Douglas Southall Freeman Prize.</p>Krick (Stonewall Jackson at Cedar Mountain) makes another significant contribution to Civil War operational history with this definitive account of the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic. Fought June 8-9, 1862, they determined the ultimate success of Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign, freeing him to move to Robert E. Lee's aid in thwarting George McClellan's advance on Richmond. These battles also solidified Jackson's reputation as a military genius, though their outcomes also reflected the incompetence of Union generals James Shields and John C. Fremont. Krick's exhaustive use of Union and Confederate primary sources, many unpublished, demonstrates as well the tactical difficulties faced by armies whose citizen-soldiers and officers were still in large part substituting courage for skill. The author's detailed attention to the human dimension of Civil War battle, including the horrors of being wounded, is facilitated by the small scale of the fighting and makes this work particularly valuable for all collections.

Profound and humorous, companionable and curmudgeonly. Walking, by America&#39;s first nature writer, is your personal and portable guide to the activity that, like no other, awakens the senses and soul to the &#39;absolute freedom and wildness&#39; of nature.Henry David Thoreau (1817&#x2013;1862) (properly pronounced Thaw-roe) was an American author, poet, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry total over 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions were his writings on natural history and philosophy, where he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close natural observation, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore; while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and "Yankee" love of practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs. He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience influenced the political thoughts and actions of such later figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Thoreau is sometimes cited as an individualist anarchist. Though Civil Disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government &#x2013; "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government" &#x2013; the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have." Richard Drinnon partly blames Thoreau for the ambiguity, noting that Thoreau's "sly satire, his liking for wide margins for his writing, and his fondness for paradox provided ammunition for widely divergent interpretations of 'Civil Disobedience.'" He further points out that although Thoreau writes that he only wants "at once" a better government, that does not rule out the possibility that a little later he might favor no government.</p><h2>Basic Technical Mathematics (10th Edition)</h2><p><p>This tried-and-true text from Allyn Washington preserves the author's highly regarded approach to technical math, while enhancing the integration of technology.

Here, too, are his discussions of the worlds we visit in dreams and in out-of-body states, a far-reaching exploration of the dynamics of desire and free will, and new &#34;practice elements,&#34; Seth&#39;s specific directions on how to explore your own &#34;unknown&#34; reality. Appendices include previously unpublished sessions on such topics as godhood, beliefs, Seth&#39;s own personal reality, UFOs and Atlantis, as well as other data from Jane Roberts&#39; ESP classes. A cumulative index covers all the material in both Volumes One and Two. This final volume of The &#34;Unknown Reality&#34; dramatically expands the conceptions o selfhood, showing that every human personality is literally infinite in his or her scope and potential.</p><p></p><h2>Seek My Face Speak My Name: A Contemporary Jewish Theology</h2><p>The new Jewish spirituality lies somewhere between God&#x2019;s elusive presence in our world and our search for authentic language to describe it. <br>Rabbi Arthur Green leads us on a journey of discovery to seek God, the world, and ourselves.

The narrator, Shed, is one of the most memorable characters in contemporary fiction: a half-Indian bisexual boy who lives and works at the Indian Head Hotel in the tiny town of Excellent, Idaho. It&#39;s the turn of the century, and the hotel carries on a prosperous business as the town&#39;s brothel. The eccentric characters working in the hotel provide Shed with a surrogate family, yet he finds in himself a growing need to learn the meaning of his Indian name, Duivichi-un-Dua, given to him by his mother, who was murdered when he was twelve. Setting off alone across the haunting plains, Shed goes in search of an identity among his true people, encountering a rich pageant of extraordinary characters along the way. Although he learns a great deal about the mysteries and traditions of his Indian heritage, it is not until Shed returns to Excellent and witnesses a series of brutal tragedies that he attains the wisdom that infuses this exceptional and captivating book.</p><p>Tom Spanbauer is the author of three previous novels, Far Away Places, The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon and In the City of Shy Hunters.

For decades he has made it the focus of his work to guide spiritual directors in the rich Ignatian discipline which currently is experiencing a remarkable renaissance far beyond the Catholic realm. Out of this work grew the <i>Handbook for Spiritual Directors</i> which will make Fr. Gallagher&#x2019;s extraordinary teaching available to Fr. Gallagher&#x2019;s growing audience around the world. This book helps spiritual directors guide the process of Ignatian discernment in a very practical and yet profoundly spiritual way. Spiritual directors receive few requests more often, and more demanding than that of helping a person discern God&#x2019;s will in life&#x2019;s taxing decisions. With this handbook, Fr. Gallagher has provided the means necessary for responding to and helping with this request. For those spiritual directors trained in Ignatian spirituality this book offers to become an essential companion, and for those who want to learn this form of discernment this book will provide the foundation for understanding and learning this age-old, proven process for discerning the will of God.</p><p><b>Fr. Timothy M. Gallagher, O.M.V.</b> is a popular retreat leader, Ignatian scholar, and lecturer around the world. He holds a doctorate from the Gregorian University and is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>The Examen Prayer.</i>"This highly practical and lucidly written book is yet another example of why Father Timothy M. Gallagher, O.M. V., is America's preeminent interpreter of and writer on Ignatian spiritual direction and discernment." &#x2014;Harvey D, Egan, S.J., Emeritus Professor of Systematic and Mystical Theology, Boston College<br><br>"I have used Fr. Timothy M. Gallagher's work on Ignatian discernment for both personal reflection and teaching, from the undergraduate to the doctoral levels. He has established himself as the one of the premier interpreters of Saint Ignatius of Loyola writing in English today, and this book is no exception. A beautiful example of profoundly pastoral theology, <i>Discerning the Will of God: A Handbook for Spiritual Directors</i> offers an important complement to his earlier work <i>Discerning the Will of God: An Ignatian Guide to Christian Decision Making</i>, which has been a source of consolation for many today who seek guidance from Ignatius's wisdom about discernment. This new book will be a sine qua non for the training of spiritual directors, especially as interest in Ignatian discernment grows at retreat centers, parishes, and universities worldwide. I am grateful for the important work that Fr. Gallagher has undertaken and for the many who will benefit from his work." &#x2014;Tim Muldoon, author of <i>The Ignatian Workout and Living Against the Grain: How to Make Decisions that Lead to an Authentic Life</i><br><br>"A wonderful book! Sure to become a standard text for those in ministry. It will be an invaluable resource for all spiritual directors and those in pastoral ministry. Simply put, Gallagher "gets" St. Ignatius of Loyola. He understands Loyola's timeless wisdom and effectively teaches the reader to understand it as well." &#x2014;Mark E. Thibodeaux, S.J., spiritual director and author of <i>Armchair Mystic and God, I Have Issues</i><br><br>"The fruit of mature reflection and prayer, Fr. Timothy Gallagher's book, aimed specifically at assisting those who help others to discern the will of God, has been eagerly awaited by spiritual directors. With the hallmark of his earlier work Gallagher employs pertinent existential experiences to illustrate and concretize his points and helpful scriptural readings for prayer. Importantly, the work exemplifies the dispositions that Gallagher seeks to inculcate not just in would be "discerners" but also and significantly in the directors themselves. These involve a maturity and disciplined practice regarding prayer, both meditation and contemplation; faithfulness to making the examen; the review of prayer and attending to repetition; and an ongoing conscious employment of the rules for discernment. The goal is to be so well disposed that openness to the will of God becomes a deep fissure within. Though the aim is to assist the "discerner" spiritual directors know well that they are blessed in and through the process. This work makes clear our challenge is to be deeply honed instruments for such service!" &#x2014;Gill Goulding C.J., Professor Systematic Theology Regis College, Toronto<br><br>"It is one thing to understand St. Ignatius' teaching on discerning the will of God, and quite another to understand how to apply that teaching in guiding particular persons in vocational discernment. Fr. Gallagher draws on his many years of study and experience to provide a practical guidebook for those privileged to accompany others in discerning the will of God. This book has strengthened my confidence as a spiritual director." &#x2014;Daniel P. Barron, O.M.V., Director of Spiritual Formation, St. John Vianney Theological Seminary, Denver, CO<br><br>"Fr. Gallagher provides a much-needed handbook that supports spiritual directors in accompanying others through St. Ignatius' classic guidelines for spiritual decision-making. He is a sure guide who leads us with clarity and helpful precision through Ignatian terminology and method. Always faithful to the mind of Ignatius, Fr. Gallagher supplements the original laconic text by helping to answer many of the questions that we may have wanted to ask Ignatius. This is an eminently useful reference book, full of illuminating insights and practical suggestions."&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;Paul Empsall, spiritual director, faculty of the Ignatian Centre, Montreal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The text of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius is meant as an aid to &#x201c;the one who gives the Exercises.&#x201d; It is, therefore, the first handbook or directory to guide a person who engages in this ministry. However, its brevity and economy of words led, even in Ignatius&#x2019; lifetime, to requests for further clarifications. Hence the series of Directories penned by various Jesuit authors during the sixteenth century that culminated in the comprehensive <i>Official Directory of 1599</i>. This is the practice or genre continued by Timothy Gallagher in his latest contribution to Ignatian studies. However, rather than producing a handbook for giving the Exercises as a whole, Gallagher here has a precise and focused issue in his sights: how does a spiritual director guide someone seeking help in discovering God&#x2019;s will in their life? This question can be posed within a retreat situation but also (perhaps more frequently) outside such a context, i.e. in the course of ordinary life. In either case, Gallagher argues, the director&#x2019;s approach, expectations, and role will be essentially the same. Readers who are conversant with Gallagher&#x2019;s other writings will recognize here a familiar methodology. As always he relies on his detailed, empathetic knowledge of the Spiritual Exercises themselves, and also of the early Directories. This provides him with a sound basis on which to build his contemporary interpretation and presentation of the tradition. A characteristic part of Gallagher&#x2019;s style has also been his use of case studies, mostly drawn from his own long experience of being a spiritual director of the Ignatian School. These real-life stories put flesh and blood on the teaching of Ignatius as it applies (in this book) to serious, committed, faith-filled decision-making. Their relevance is always clear and enlightening." &#x2014;Brian O&#x2019;Leary, S.J., writer and retreat director, Dublin, Ireland<br><br>"Fr. Gallagher gives spiritual directors the insight and tools needed to help others to lay the foundation for discerning the will of God, to remove the human and spiritual obstacles to discovering it, and to form the proper disposition of heart for cooperating with it. This handbook offers wise and practical help for all who accompany others in the spiritual life." &#x2014;Christina Lynch, Ph.D., Director of Psychological Services, St. John Vianney Theological Seminary, Denver, CO<br><br>"Fr. Timothy Gallagher has succeeded in writing an important and very useful sequel to his<i> Discerning the Will of God: An Ignatian Guide to Christian Decision Making</i>. It is addressed especially to spiritual directors who may be journeying with someone who is discerning God's will in their life. Spiritual directors will find important, practical examples and settings to help them in the indispensable ministry of accompanying someone discerning God's will outside the context of the "full" Spiritual Exercises." &#x2014;Ernest Sherstone, O.M.V., Founder of the Lanteri Center for Ignatian Spirituality, Denver, and director of St. Joseph Retreat House, Milton, MA<br><br>"Spiritual directors and those who form them will find a treasure in Fr. Timothy Gallagher's book, <i>Discerning the Will of God: A Handbook for Spiritual Directors</i>. Fr. Gallagher's careful study of classical texts have brought clarity and depth to the understanding of Ignatian discernment. He facilitates a transfer of wisdom from these first spiritual directors to contemporary ones who are asking similar questions about the faithful accompaniment of those who truly desire to choose God's will. Accessible, thoughtful, and pastorally sensitive, this book is sure to be a lasting resource for teachers and directors alike." &#x2014;Catherine Macaulay, spiritual director, wife, and mother, faculty of the Ignatian Centre, Montreal <br><br>"In this handbook for spiritual directors, Timothy Gallagher, O.M.V., has made the process of spiritual discernment come alive. His explanations are clear and help to demystify the elements of the discernment process in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. This book is an important reference for spiritual directors who accompany others as they reflect on and make important decisions. Thank you Fr. Gallagher for producing this valuable resource." &#x2014;Elizabeth Koessler, spiritual director, wife, and mother, faculty of the Ignatian Centre, Montreal</p><h2>Living the Extraordinary Life: 9 Principles to Discover It</h2><p><p>To many in the world, the Christian faith is a set of rules and regulations.

Designed to supplement all textbooks of physical chemistry, this book will help today's physical chemistry students succeed in their course. </p> <b>This book features:</b> <ul> <li>Introductory chapters that deal with coordinate systems, functions and graphs, and the use of logarithms.</li> <li>Chapters on differential and integral calculus.</li> <li>A chapter of mathematical methods in the laboratory, including error analysis, propagation of errors, linear regression calculations, and preparing graphs.</li> <li>An introduction to differential equations.</li> <li>A chapter illustrating the use of Fourier series and Fourier transforms.</li> <li>Problems at the end of each chapter, with answers to all problems in an appendix.</li> </ul> <b>New to this edition:</b> <ul> <li>A completely revised chapter on <i>Numerical Methods and the Use of the Computer</i> that illustrates how to complete calculations using Microsoft Excel&#x2122;.</li> </ul><p> A perusal of many modern physical chemistry texts demonstrates that most authors of these texts and the professors who use them, such as myself, expect students to know a great deal more mathematics than is covered in the calculus courses normally required for physical chemistry courses. Moreover, we honestly expect that our students will know how to apply the mathematics they have learned to physical problems. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues and I have found that this generally is not the case. It was this observation, along with the fact that I was spending a great deal of lecture time teaching mathematics rather than physical chemistry in my physical chemistry course, that inspired me to write the first edition of this text some 30 years ago. </p> <p> It is my intention, therefore, that this third edition be used as a supplement along with the student's physical chemistry textbook, to help students either review or, perhaps, learn for the first time those areas of mathematics that are essential to an understanding of physical chemistry, and, more importantly, to apply that mathematics to physical problems. The purpose of the book is not to replace the mathematics courses that are prerequisite to the physical chemistry course, but to be a how to do it review mathematics textbook. Consequently, the problems at the end of each chapter are designed to test the reader's mathematical skills, not his or her skills in solving physical chemistry problems. </p> <p> Like the first two editions, the first five chapters concentrate on subject matter normally covered in prerequisite mathematics courses and should be a review. Again, an emphasis in the chapter on integral calculus has been placed an using integral tables, and, in keeping with the original intent of the book, mathematical rigor was kept at a minimum, giving way to intuition where possible. </p> <p> The latter half of the text covers important material normally not covered in prerequisite courses, but, for the most part, at an introductory level. For example, the chapter on differential equations emphasizes the solution of second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients, common to many simple problems in wave mechanics. Also, as in the second edition, sections on the series method of solving differential equations are included. The sections on Fourier series and Fourier transforms have been expanded in this edition to include discrete Fourier transforms and well as continuous Fourier transforms. Discrete Fourier transforms are important in many areas of spectroscopy, since they can be handled by digital computers. </p> <p> Finally, the chapter on numerical methods has been completely revised. In the second edition, we concentrated on writing programs using BASIC to do the numerical calculations. Over the recent years, however, there has been a move away from using compiled programs for doing scientific computations toward the use of spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excelï¿½, for such computations. Thus, the new chapter concentrates on using a spreadsheet to do many standard numerical calculations, such as numerical integration, fitting curves to experimental data, and finding discrete Fourier transforms of functions. </p> <p> As I mentioned in the Preface to the second edition, a text such as this could not be a success without the contributions of a number of people. I especially wish to thank Professor John Bopp, Nazareth College; Professor Wayne Bosma, Bradley University; and Professor Greg Peters, University of Memphis for their careful and critical review of the second edition and their many helpful comments and suggestions. I also would like to thank Professor John Wheeler of the University of California, San Diego, for finding a serious error in one of the examples in the chapter on infinite series in the second edition that survived from the first edition. </p> <p> I thank my editor John Challice, Project Manager Kristen Kaiser, Production Editor Donna Young, and all those individuals at Prentice Hall ESM and Write With, Inc. who helped to improve immensely the quality of the text. </p> <p> Finally, I wish to thank my son, Stephen Barrante, who designed the cover for this edition, my wife Marlene, and our family for their patience and encouragement during the preparation of this book. </p> <p> I welcome comments on the text and ask that any comments or errors found be sent to me at <i>jrbarrante@aol.com</i>. </p> <p> JAMES R.

This version aims to be different from other editions of the play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.According to legend, Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted with the character of Sir John Falstaff in <i>Henry IV,</i> Parts I and II, that she commanded Shakespeare to create a romantic comedy depicting the jolly old rogue in love. The obedient playwright responded with <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor,</i> a lively and enduring farce that offers a humorous rebuff to lechery and hypocrisy.<br>Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth. Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices&#x2014;romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities&#x2014;enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.<br>Dover (2014) unabridged republication of a standard edition.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p><h2>James For You (God&#39;s Word For You)</h2><p>What is the difference between genuine faith and counterfeit faith?

Begining with a brief discussion of the importance of history when approaching spiritual traditions, this book then, working within a broad chronological framework, goes on to draws out the distinctive themes and emphases of Christian spirituality and show how and why different styles of spirituality have emerged at different points throughout history.

Often it's a small breach such as being spoken to rudely or overlooked in a time of need. Other times we experience lies, gossip, or harsh words that cut us to the core. Some of us have endured unspeakable pain through abuse, adultery, or abandonment. God knows the pain we cause each other and longs to help us learn to practice forgiveness. Nowhere do we see forgiveness played out more fully in Scripture than in the biblical story of Joseph.</p> <p>This six-week study explores what God has to say to us about grace and forgiveness through Joseph's story of trial and triumph found in Genesis 37-50. As we study his dreams, his betrayers, his dysfunctional family, his struggle to forgive, and his journey toward reconciliation, we'll find truths that echo into our own personal situations as well as practical help for answering common questions, such as: </p> How do I stop dwelling on the hurt?<br> Is forgiving someone excusing what happened?<br> When will I stop having to re-forgive?<br> Is there a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation?<br> How can I forgive and still set boundaries?<br> Is it ever okay not to forgive?<br> <p>Whether or not you are working through a hurtful situation right now, you can learn from Joseph how to release your past and present hurts to God and allow Him to do a supernatural work of forgiveness in your life. God wants to use the very things intended to hurt you as a source of blessing in your life and the lives of others. </p> <p> The Participant Book includes five days of lessons for each week, combining study of Scripture with personal reflection, application, and prayer. </p> <p>Other components for the Bible study, available separately, include a Leader Guide, DVD with six 20-25 minute sessions, and boxed Leader Kit (an all-inclusive box containing one copy of each of the Bible study&#x2019;s components).</p></p><p><p>Melissa Spoelstra is a popular women&#x2019;s conference speaker (including the Aspire Women&#x2019;s Events), Bible teacher, and author who is madly in love with Jesus and passionate about helping others to seek Christ and know Him more intimately. </p><p>She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Bible Theology and enjoys teaching God&#x2019;s Word to diverse groups and churches within the body of Christ.

However, this not-so-easy-to-use reference of journalistic style is often not up-to-date and leaves reporters and copyeditors unsatisfied. Bill Walsh, copy chief for the <i>Washington Post's</i> business desk, addresses these shortcomings in <i>Lapsing into a Comma</i>. In an opinionated, humorous, and yes, curmudgeonly way, he shows how to apply the basic rules to unique, modern grammar issues. Walsh explains how to deal with perplexing situations such as trendy words, foreign terms, and web speak.</p></p><p>Who knew a stylebook could be so much fun? For lovers of language, <i>Lapsing Into a Comma</i> is a sensible and very funny guide to the technicalities of writing and copy editing. Author Bill Walsh, chief copy editor in the business section of the <i>Washington Post</i>, humorously discusses the changing rules of proper print style in the information age. Is it "e-mail" or "email"? According to established grammatical rules, it should be <i>e-mail</i>, but in common practice, we often use <i>email</i> (which should be pronounced "uhmail," but we all know not to do that). Therefore, email is OK.<p> Walsh does not advocate tossing your <i>AP Stylebook</i>, but he does encourage using your head and not blindly adhering to formal rules. "A finely tuned ear is at least as important as formal grammar," he says, "and that's not something you can acquire by memorizing a stylebook." What about companies that use punctuation in their logos? Walsh cautions against confusing a logo with a name. You wouldn't use "Tech Stock Surge Boosts Yahoo!" as a headline unless you wrote for a very excitable newspaper. And then there's arbitrary capitalization. "The dot-com era has leveled a wall that Adidas and K.D. Lang and <i>Thirtysomething</i> had already cracked," says Walsh, "and suddenly writers and editors faced with a name are asking, "Is that capitalized?"--a question that's about as appropriate as asking a 5-year-old, 'Do you want that Coke with or without rum?'"</p><p> The first half of <i>Lapsing Into a Comma</i> zips along, making you think about the intricacies of grammar and editing--all while trying not to choke on laughter. The second half is Walsh's personally crafted style guide.

"It remains," Ker continues, "the classic text for the theology of the development of doctrine, a branch of theology which has become especially important in the ecumenical era." <p>John Henry Cardinal Newman begins the <i>Essay</i> by defining how true developments in doctrine occur. He then delivers a sweeping consideration of the growth and development of doctrine in the Catholic Church, from the time of the Apostles to Newman&#x2019;s own era. He demonstrates that the basic "rule" under which Christianity proceeded through the centuries is to be found in the principle of development, and emphasizes that thoughout the entire life of the Church this law of development has been in effect and safeguards the faith from any real corruption. </p><p>Ker concludes that, "we may say that the <i>Essay</i> is not only the starting point for the study of doctrinal development, but so far as Catholic theology is concerned, it is still the last word on the subject, to the extent that no other theologian has yet attempted anything on the same scale or of similar scope. . . . But even if the <i>Essay</i> was not one of the great theological classics, it would still be of enduring interest for two reasons. First it is one of the key intellectual documents of the nineteenth century, comparable to Darwin&#x2019;s <i>Origin of Species</i>, which it predates by over a decade. Second, if this were the only book of Newman to survive, its rhetorical art and style would surely place him among the masters of English prose."</p></p><p>John Henry Newman (1801-90) was a Roman Catholic cardinal and one of the founders of the Oxford Movement.

To the sailors who learned to fear them, the body-crashing warriors of Japan were known as suiciders; among the Japanese, they were named for a divine wind that once saved the home islands from invasion: <i>kamikaze. </i>Told from the perspective of the men who endured this horrifying tactic, <i>At War with the Wind</i> is the first book to recount in nail-biting detail what it was like to experience an attack by Japanese kamikazes. David Sears, acclaimed author of <i>The Last Epic Naval Battle,</i> draws on personal interviews and unprecedented research to create a narrative of war that is stunning in its vivid re-creations. Born of desperation in the face of overwhelming material superiority, suicide attacks by aircraft, submarines, small boats, and even manned rocket-boosted gliders were capable of inflicting catastrophic damage, testing the resolve of officers and sailors as never before. Sears s gripping account focuses on the vessels whose crews experienced the full range of the kamikaze nightmare. From carrier USS St. Lo, the first U.S. Navy vessel sunk by an orchestrated kamikaze attack, to USS <i>Henrico,</i> a transport ship that survived the landings at Normandy only to be sent to the Pacific and struck by suicide planes off Okinawa, and USS <i>Mannert L. Abele,</i> the only vessel sunk by a rocket-boosted piloted glider during the war, these unforgettable stories reveal, as never before, one of the most horrifying and misunderstood chapters of World War II. </p><p>This is the candid story of a war within a war a relentless series of furious and violent engagements pitting men determined to die against men determined to live. Its echoes resonate hauntingly at a time of global conflict, when suicide as a weapon remains a perplexing and terrifying reality. </p><p>November 1, 1945 Leyte Gulf </p><p>The destroyer Killen (DD-593) was besieged, shooting down four planes, but taking a bomb hit from a fifth. Pharmacist mate Ray Cloud, watching from the fantail, saw the plane a sleek twin-engine Frances fighter-bomber swoop in low across the port side. As its pilot released his bomb, Cloud said to himself, He dropped it too soon, and then watched as the plane roared by pursued and chewed up by fire from <i>Killen's</i> 40- and 20-mm guns. </p><p>The bomb hit the water, skipped once and then penetrated <i>Killen's</i> port side hull forward, exploding between the #2 and #3 magazines. The blast tore a gaping hole in <i>Killen's</i> side and water poured in. By the time Donice Copeland, eighteen, a radar petty officer, emerged on deck from the radar shack, the ship's bow was practically submerged and the ship itself was nearly dead in the water. </p><p>Practically all the casualties were awash below decks. Two unwounded sailors, trapped below in the ship's emergency generator room, soon drowned. The final tally of dead eventually climbed to fifteen.</p></p><p>David Sears is a New Jersey-based business consultant and author. A former United States Navy officer with extensive sea duty aboard a destroyer, as well as a Vietnam war veteran, he is the author of <i>The Last Epic Naval Battle: Voices from Leyte Gulf. </i>In researching and writing <i>At War with the Wind,</i> he carried out extensive original research and hundreds of personal interviews.A victor's-eye view of the desperate suicide-bombing campaign in the closing months of World War II.Former naval officer Sears (The Last Epic Naval Battle: Voices from Leyte Gulf, 2005) writes affectingly of the terror the "divine wind" campaign wrought on American sailors. Contrasting the fate of several American ships to that of USS Cole in the 2000 al-Qaeda terror attack, he demonstrates the damage that the Imperial Navy suicide bombers wrought. That campaign, he observes, was a mark of having no other options, the American fleet having destroyed most of Japan's and forcing "a stunning new 'backs-against-the-wall' paradigm for modern warfare." The author focuses on U.S. forces, though with considerable attention to the Japanese side of the equation, for which readers will also want to consult Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney's provocative Kamikaze Diaries (2006) and Albert Axell's Kamikaze: Japan's Suicide Gods (2002). Sears does a particularly good job of bringing in the various voices of the fast-dwindling corps of American survivors of hellish engagements at Leyte and Okinawa, among other places. Drawing on interviews, diaries and other sources, the author depicts men such as a Marine junior officer who, his soldiers suspected, slept at attention, in contrast with one of those fighters who weighed only 135 pounds and was "quiet, introspective, and mild mannered." Both served valiantly, as did most of their comrades, even though, by the closing months of the war, recruits were pushed through training and sent into the field as "90-day wonders fresh from Midshipman School." The horror of kamikaze steeled them - those who survived, that is, for the attacks took a terrible toll on American sailors, Marines and soldiers, which left "even the healthiest veterans perplexed and embittered at a nation, culture, and people capable of devising such attacks." Sears closes with a look at how veterans on both sides bridged the gulf between them.Of considerable interest to students of the Pacific War.

Rich in anecdote and insight, <strong></strong><strong><em>Vested Interests</em></strong><strong></strong> offers a provocative and entertaining view of our ongoing obsession with dressing up--and with the power of clothes.</p><p>Director of the Humanities Center at HarvardAn elaborate theory by Garber (English/Harvard), insisting that the transvestite is at the elusive heart of Western culture. In a century-sweeping book, Garber applies current critical thought to the phenomenon of ``cross-dressing'' in fact and fiction, high culture and low. Arguing that gender is culturally constructed, she contends that cross-dressing challenges the binary categories of male and female as well as the concept of category itself. It signals ``cultural, social or aesthetic dissonances.'' Garber argues that critics have looked ``through,'' not ``at,'' the transvestite, failing to see what is a Freudian ``primal scene.'' Defined here again and again, the transvestite is ``the space of desire,'' ``a space of possibility,'' a ``third.'' Garber plays out her theory in detailed analyses of countless transvestite figures- -Shakespearean heroines, Tootsie, Lawrence of Arabia, M. Butterfly, Madonna, and Laurence Olivier (here portrayed at death as ``the triumphant transvestite''). There is no shortage of provocative speculation and information, some worth considering and some--like that about transvestite magazines and the politics of transsexual surgery--not. Unfortunately, the sub-flooring of French critical terms sets Garber's argument on a slippery slope ending up too often in a theoretical mire where ``the transvestite is both a signifier and that which signifies the undecidability of signification.'' A discussion of Elizabethan dress codes and costuming concludes with the typically reductive claim that ``there is no ground of Shakespeare that is not already cross-dressed.'' Also, when critical terms are rampantly applied--Elvis and Liberace, for instance, labeled, like Peter Pan, ``changeling boys''--they quickly lose impact. Bound for controversy, this study admirably attempts to cross from the academy to popular culture, but theory here acts less as a window onto cultural evolution than as a screen drawing attention its own overwrought, repetitive pattern.

But leaders know that today, pressures for change don&#x2019;t come at you one at a time; they come all at once. It&#x2019;s like riding a roller coaster: sudden drops, jarring turns, anxious climbs into the unknown. Drawing on his years of experience at the Center for Creative Leadership and Columbia University, Bill Pasmore offers a four-part model and four mindsets that allow leaders to deal with multiple changes simultaneously without drowning in the churn. <br><br> The first step, Pasmore says, is to <b>Discover</b> which external pressures for change are the most necessary to address. The key here is to think fewer&#x2014;step away from the buffet of possibilities and pinpoint the highest-impact options. Then you need to <b>Decide</b> how many change efforts your organization can handle. Here the mindset is to think scarcer&#x2014;you have only so many people and so many resources, so how do you best use them? Once you&#x2019;ve figured that out, it&#x2019;s time to <b>Do</b>&#x2014;and here you want to think faster. Streamline processes and engage in rapid prototyping so you can learn quickly and cost-effectively. The last step is to <b>Discern</b> what worked and what didn&#x2019;t, so think smarter&#x2014;develop metrics, identify trends, and make sure learnings are disseminated throughout the organization.<br><br> For each stage of the process, Pasmore offers detailed advice, practical tools, and real-world examples. This book is a comprehensive guide to navigating change the way it happens now.</p><p>Change has become constant, complex, multifaceted, and overwhelming. To meet this challenge, Bill Pasmore presents four keys to help leaders decide where and how to most effectively focus their change initiatives.Bill Pasmore is a senior vice president and global organizational practice leader for the Center for Creative Leadership, which annually provides executive education to more than 20,000 individuals and 2,000 organizations, including more than 80 of the Fortune 100 companies.

That this country is a beautiful confabulation, a consolation existing only in his maternal grandmother's mind, makes it no less real. Though Charlotte Lemonnier lives in a town on the edge of the steppe, each night she journeys to a long-ago Paris, telling tales that the children then translate with their more Russian minds: "The president of the Republic was bound to have something Stalinesque about him in the portrait sketched by our imagination. Neuilly was peopled with kolkhozniks. And the slow emergence of Paris from the waters evoked a very Russian emotion--that of fleeting relief after one more historic cataclysm ..." <p> Makine's first novel is a singing tribute to the alchemy of inspiration, but it is no less familiar with the sorrows of reality. And it is only as he gets older that the narrator begins to piece together his grandmother's far more tragic past--her experiences in the Great War, the October Revolution, and after. <i>Dreams of My Russian Summers</i> is a love letter to an extraordinary woman (it's hard not to see the book as autobiographical) as well as to language and literature, which the boy turns to in avoidance of history's manipulations. It has all the marks of an instant classic.</p>Andrei Makine was born in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia in 1957, but sought asylum in France in 1987. While initially sleeping rough in Paris he was writing his first novel, A HERO&#39;S DAUGHTER, which was eventually published in 1990 after Makine pretended it had been translated from the Russian, since no publisher believed he could have written it in French. With his third novel, ONCE UPON A RIVER LOVE, he was finally published as a &#39;French&#39; writer, and with his fourth, LE TESTAMENT FRANCAIS, he became the first author to win both of France&#39;s top literary prizes, the Prix Goncourt and Prix Medicis. Since then Andrei Makine has written THE CRIME OF OLGA ARBYELINA, REQUIEM FOR THE EAST, A LIFE&#39;S MUSIC, which won the Grand Prix RTL-Lire, and THE EARTH AND SKY OF JACQUES DORME.</p><h2>What Is World Literature? (Translation/Transnation, 5)</h2><p><p>World literature was long defined in North America as an established canon of European masterpieces, but an emerging global perspective has challenged both this European focus and the very category of "the masterpiece." The first book to look broadly at the contemporary scope and purposes of world literature, What Is World Literature? probes the uses and abuses of world literature in a rapidly changing world.</p><br><p> In case studies ranging from the Sumerians to the Aztecs and from medieval mysticism to postmodern metafiction, David Damrosch looks at the ways works change as they move from national to global contexts. Presenting world literature not as a canon of texts but as a mode of circulation and of reading, Damrosch argues that world literature is work that gains in translation. When it is effectively presented, a work of world literature moves into an elliptical space created between the source and receiving cultures, shaped by both but circumscribed by neither alone. Established classics and new discoveries alike participate in this mode of circulation, but they can be seriously mishandled in the process.

Rosenberg is stunned to discover that Goethe, his idol, was a great admirer of the Jewish seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Long after graduation, Rosenberg remains haunted by this ";Spinoza problem";: how could the German genius Goethe have been inspired by a member of a race Rosenberg considers so inferior to his own, a race he was determined to destroy?Spinoza himself was no stranger to punishment during his lifetime. Because of his unorthodox religious views, he was excommunicated from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656, at the age of twenty-four, and banished from the only world he had ever known.

After his father's death the family moved to Sarehole, on the south-eastern edge of Birmingham. Tolkien spent a happy childhood in the countryside and his sensibility to the rural landscape can clearly be seen in his writing and his pictures.His mother died when he was only twelve and both he and his brother were made wards of the local priest and sent to King Edward's School, Birmingham, where Tolkien shone in his classical work. After completing a First in English Language and Literature at Oxford, Tolkien married Edith Bratt. He was also commissioned in the Lancashire Fusiliers and fought in the battle of the Somme. After the war, he obtained a post on the New English Dictionary and began to write the mythological and legendary cycle which he originally called The Book of Lost Tales but which eventually became known as The Silmarillion.In 1920 Tolkien was appointed Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds which was the beginning of a distinguished academic career culminating with his election as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. Meanwhile Tolkien wrote for his children and told them the story of The Hobbit. It was his publisher, Stanley Unwin, who asked for a sequel to The Hobbit and gradually Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, a huge story that took twelve years to complete and which was not published until Tolkien was approaching retirement. After retirement Tolkien and his wife lived near Oxford, but then moved to Bournemouth. Tolkien returned to Oxford after his wife's death in 1971. He died on 2 September 1973 leaving The Silmarillion to be edited for publication by his son, Christopher.</p></p><h2>Math Level 4: Lessons for a Living Education</h2><p>The <i>Math Lessons for a Living Education</i> series helps take math from the pages of a book and place it in the context of real-life situations so that kids can see the practical application of these concepts.

It's a real, down-to-earth capacity that we all possess and can develop. Intuition is as natural as all your other senses and functions as a transmitter of body-mind messages that you can use to guide your actions. <b>Awakening Intuition</b> teaches you how to hone your receptivity to intuitive messages by attending to the clues of your body--including symptoms of physical disorder and disease, dreams and internal visions, voices, body sensations, emotional reactions, and memories.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Like <i>Spontaneous Healing</i> and <i>Anatomy of the Spirit,</i> <b>Awakening Intuition</b> illuminates the intimate connections between the mind, body, and emotions. Like <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,</i> the book provides astonishing new perspectives on what science has uncovered about the powers of the mind and cellular memories. Dr. Schulz tells fascinating personal stories of how she used her own intuition to heal her illnesses and her life and offers practical, proven guidelines for how you can develop your own intuitive guidance system and get your mind and body in sync. Dr. Schulz's always riveting, sometimes poignant, and often entertaining stories of how clients have used their own intuition to gain insight into the underlying meaning of their disorders and life challenges will inspire you to learn your own body's unique perceptive language. By learning to read and understand your sensations, movements, and memories and the signals of distress and disease, you will strengthen your mind-body consciousness and empower yourself to create a healthier, happier life.</p><p><i>Awakening Intuition</i> explores the idea that learning to use intuition and understanding its connection with memories, dreams, and healing can strengthen your body against disease and enrich your life. Using case studies, author Mona Lisa Shultz portrays her belief that emotions and diseases are linked, what areas of the body are affected by what kinds of feelings, and how we can tune in to the cause of an ailment. Indeed, Schultz describes curing herself of a brain disorder using intuition, and claims she keeps her Graves' disease in remission solely through this work. <p> Schultz's basic treatise is that the body is continuously sending us messages through symptoms and symbols to get our attention. By heeding these messages and using intuition to decode them, we can make changes that enhance our health and emotional well-being. </p><p> Schultz is a physician, neuropsychiatrist, and neuroscientist who has worked as a "medical intuitive" for more than a decade. Far from claiming extraordinary powers, Schultz believes we are all intuitive and can train ourselves to tap into our resources. "It's a real down-to-earth capacity that is available to anyone willing to tune in his transmitter and listen in to what's being broadcast," writes Schultz. "The information it offers us is practical, and it can immeasurably improve and enrich our lives." <i>--Joan Price</i></p>"By reading this book and applying Dr. Schulz's lightning to your own tough seeds, you too can find healing, new growth, and a new life."<br>--From the Foreword by Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom Advance Praise for Awakening Intuition<br><br>"Awakening Intuition is absolutely the most brilliant book on the mind-body relationship that has ever been written. I simply couldn't put it down. Grounded in the latest research, it comes alive through intuitive readings, clinical anecdotes, and the fascinating life story of Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz. Her sense of humor shines through on every page as she illuminates emotional territory with lightning clarity,<br>encouraging us not only to heal our wounds, but to use our gifts."<br>--Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind and<br>A Woman's Book of Life: The Biology, Psychology, and Spirituality of the Feminine Lifecycle<br><br>"If there are any doubts that we contain majestic, unused gifts for knowing, this book should erase them. For a picture of what we can be, Awakening Intuition is a blueprint. Schulz kicks modern medicine and psychology into high gear. Be careful. After reading this book, you may be unable to revert to a business-as-usual way of understanding your life and your health."<br>--Larry Dossey, M.D., author of Be Careful What You Pray For, Prayer Is Good Medicine, and Recovering the Soul</p><h2>Basic Texas Books: An Annotated Bibliography of Selected Works for a Research Library(Revised Edition)</h2><p><p>Anyone interested in Texas history will find Jenkins's bibliography indispensable.

It is a candid retrospective of the extraordinary success achieved, and the prices that had to be paid.<br><br>&#x201c;After &#x2018;Snowbird&#x2019; hit, I was swept up like Dorothy in<i> The Wizard of Oz</i>, and catapulted into a strange new universe ... If I thought for a moment that I was really in control of events, I was deluded.&#x201d; Anne Murray<br><br>An unflinching self-portrait of Canada&#x2019;s first great female recording artist, <b>All of Me</b> documents the life of Anne Murray, from her humble origins in the tragedy-plagued coal-mining town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, to her arrival on the world stage. Anne recounts her story: the battles with her record companies over singles and albums; the struggle with drug- and alcohol-ridden band members; the terrible guilt and loneliness of being away from her two young children; her divorce from the man who helped launch her career, Bill Langstroth; and the deaths of two of her closest confidantes.&nbsp;The result is a must-read autobiography by Canada&#x2019;s beloved songbird.</p><p>Born and raised in Springhill, Nova Scotia, Anne Murray has enjoyed an unparalleled career, delighting millions with her signature voice and time-honoured songs. Over a four-decade-long career, she&#x2019;s sold 54 million records, putting more than 30 pop hits, 50 country tunes and over 40 adult contemporary songs on the Billboard charts.<b>Chapter One</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My mother had prayed for a little girl.<br>&nbsp;<br>Every day during her fourth pregnancy, Marion Murray entreated Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary, to deliver a girl to join her three young sons. This was not an idle request. Mom took her prayers-and her Catholicism-very seriously. She lit candles, said novenas and promised Saint Anne that if she were to be blessed with a girl, she would call her Anne. In the end, when I was delivered by Dr. Harold Simpson on the morning of June 20, 1945, at All Saints Hospital in Springhill, Nova Scotia, I was named Morna Anne-Morna after my paternal grandmother. Morna came first because Morna Anne Murray flowed a lot better than Anne Morna Murray-my first lesson, perhaps, in the importance of rhythm. My mother had no doubt that it was prayer alone that had been responsible for my arrival. Such was her gratitude that virtually until the day she died, she stayed in touch with priests at the Sainte-Anne-de-Beauprï¿½ shrine in Quebec, sending regular donations.<br>&nbsp;<br>With three older brothers-David, Daniel and Harold-and later two younger ones-Stewart and Bruce-my childhood fate was largely predetermined. I didn't have a chance. Even before I could walk they had laced a pair of boxing gloves onto my hands for a family photograph. I never actually donned them for a fight, but they are an apt metaphor. I was a tomboy and relished the role, wanting to do everything my brothers did, stubbornly resisting the repeated well-intentioned efforts of my mother to transform me into a model of junior femininity. I did have dolls and I did play with them, but they were never a major part of my childhood. Only years later, long after I had left home, did my mother succeed in decorating my bedroom as she had long envisaged it, with frilly pinks and whites replacing my posters of Hollywood heartthrob James Dean and Tony Dow (<i>Leave It to Beaver</i>'s older brother, Wally). I had it bad for Tony Dow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Taught by my older brothers, I learned to catch, throw and hit a baseball with proficiency. Along with them I rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Toronto Maple Leafs, though my loyalties shifted from time to time to Dad's favourite team, the Montreal Canadiens. The boys owned a vast baseball card collection that we stored in gallon ice-cream pails. In time I memorized the batting and earned-run averages of every major-league player. My brothers liked to quiz me-they would cover up most of the card and, from the portion that remained visible, I had to identify the player and what team he played for and recite all his relevant numbers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Outdoors I was recruited for neighbourhood games and, because I had a good arm, later played centre field for our girls' softball team, the Top Hats. We won the town cham pionship, but my contribution to our victory was minimal. Despite my training, I was never a confident player, either at bat or in the field. I rarely swung at pitches and in the field I was often thinking, <i>Please, don't hit it to me</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would never be able to compete seriously with my brothers on the sports field, and I knew it. This is just a theory, but it's possible that when I discovered in my early teens that I could sing reasonably well, I worked hard at it precisely because it was one thing that I could do better than they could. I couldn't get enough of singing; it was a tonic for my otherwise deflated sense of self-esteem. But that was later. In my early years we were a sports-mad family. We swam, played baseball and hockey (Dad would rent the local skating rink for an hour on Sundays after church), and on Saturday nights during the winter and all through the Stanley Cup playoffs, watched hockey games religiously around the family TV. It was a nineteen-inch black-and-white Westinghouse with chrome legs that sat in my parents' bedroom; all eight of us and assorted friends sprawled in awkward configurations on the bed or the floor to watch it. (In his later years, whenever the Canadiens were playing, Dad would don his official Guy Lafleur number ten jersey.)<br>&nbsp;<br>They were an active bunch, my brothers; they loved to box and wrestle with each other, and often roughhoused with me as well. Until Harold went off to college, I don't think he ever missed an opportunity to slug me in the arm if I was within his considerable range. He was merciless with all of us-on the day he left, Stewart, Bruce and I cheered lustily from the back porch of our big Main Street home. On my sixteenth birthday two of the older boys administered the traditional sixteen slaps to my butt with such enthusiasm that I was brought to tears. I would fight back-writhing, wriggling, flailing, screaming and complaining frequently to Mom, but usually without results. The precise circumstances of one incident are lost in the mists of memory, but Harold had pushed me a little too far, and in a moment of anger I picked up a small rock and hurled it at him, nicking his ear (I think I was eight or nine at the time). He put his hand to his ear, felt the blood trickling down and flashed me a big, wicked grin-not because he was proud of me for fighting back, but because he knew he would need a few stitches to sew it up. And, since I had drawn blood, he knew that some form of parental wrath would be expressed and that I, for once, would be its recipient. He was going to savour that moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Much of the time, I'm sure, I was either a nuisance or a burden to my brothers-or both. Once when I was an infant, the boys wheeled me down the street in my pram and left me while they went inside a store. One small problem: they had neglected to put on the brake-and Springhill is built on a cluster of steep hills. So down the hill I went, gathering speed, until an alert neighbour spotted the careening carriage and raced out to save me. But for that timely intervention, my music career might have been aborted very early. On another occasion, while I was still a toddler, I was again consigned to the less-than-scrupulous care of the older boys. They wanted to play baseball. These two imperatives-play and supervision-conflicted, so they cleverly arrived at a solution that would keep me from wandering off: they thoughtfully tied me to a nearby tree and the game continued. At other times I was a victim of their pranks. Walking home at night from movies at the community hall in Northport, where we spent our summers, they would run ahead and hide in ditches and behind trees, leaving me alone in complete darkness. Then they'd jump out and scare me half to death.<br>&nbsp;<br>In turn, when I was charged with their care, I often regarded my younger brothers as an unwelcome responsibility. I was three years older than Stewart and six years older than Bruce, and I could be as inattentive as my older brothers had been. Once when I was ostensibly babysitting four-year-old Bruce, he decided he wanted to use the record player. To do so he had to move a lamp, which he laid down on a foam pillow, which then caught fire-while I was busy playing cards downstairs with a boyfriend. I smelled burning rubber and, Dad being at work and Mom out, my boyfriend ran to get his father. The local newspaper, the <i>Record</i>, reported the story of menacing Master Murray, the four-year-old arsonist, but no serious damage was done.<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother Daniel was the family tease. He enjoyed pinning me to the floor, his knees firmly pressing down on my shoulders so that I was immobilized, and then threatening to lick my face, inching ever closer. He denies these accusations today, but his memory is clearly flawed. Daniel had other idiosyncratic methods of torture as well. With a doctor for a father and a nurse for a mother, their six germ-carrying kids were repeatedly instructed never to drink from each other's glass or eat food the others might have touched. Daniel exploited these instructions ruthlessly. Typically Mom would have us all sit at the kitchen table while she rushed back and forth with plates of food. Even before we'd finished the main course, she'd set out the dessert as well. One of our favourites was date squares. She'd be fussing with something, her back turned, and Daniel, slowly and methodically, would take each square and carefully lick both sides, effectively claiming them as his own. After that we couldn't and wouldn't touch them. But, if we knew what was good for us, we also couldn't snitch on him to Mom. So Mom would ask, "How come no one but Daniel is eating the squares?" and we could say nothing-Daniel's withering glare warning us of dire consequences if we dared. That kitchen table, incidentally, contained a small drawer in which Bruce and I hid bread crusts, which we hated. I'd been told they put hair on your chest, and I didn't want any part of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>To be completely candid, I should confess that my treatment of my younger siblings occasionally reflected the treatment I had been accorded by the others. I once teased Bruce to the point where he threw a pair of scissors at me. At other times I had a tendency to treat both him and Stewart as living dolls, dressing them and coiffing their schoolboy hair as I-and sometimes my friends-pleased. (Hair, in fact, became something of an avocation. I used to cut Dad's hair at our cottage at Northport in the summer, and at university I ran a virtual salon, offering trims and dye jobs to my dorm-mates.) Later my attentions to Bruce and Stewart became more practical and well-intentioned: I taught them both to dance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Afraid of being ridiculed by the others, no one really expressed their fears. I certainly didn't. I vividly recall hearing, either through some fundamentalist proselytizers at our door or on the radio, that the world was coming to an end on a given day. Somehow I took this warning very seriously, but instead of articulating my mounting fear, I took refuge under my bed on the appointed day. Only when it became clear to me that the forecast had failed did I reappear.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having five brothers, I should add, was not without its benefits. They taught me far more than just how to read a box sc...</p><h2>An Appeal from Mary in Argentina: The Apparitions of San Nicolas</h2><p>An account of the September 25, 1983, appearance of the Blessed Virgin Mary to a middle-aged housewife in San Nicolas, Argentina.</p><p></p><h2>Frank: A Life in Politics from the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b></p><p><b>How did a disheveled, intellectually combative gay Jew with a thick accent become one of the most effective (and funniest) politicians of our time?</b></p><p>Growing up in Bayonne, New Jersey, the fourteen-year-old Barney Frank made two vital discoveries about himself: he was attracted to government, and to men. He resolved to make a career out of the first attraction and to keep the second a secret. Now, sixty years later, his sexual orientation is widely accepted, while his belief in government is embattled. </p><p><i>Frank: A Life in Politics from the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage</i> is one man's account of the country's transformation--and the tale of a truly momentous career. Many Americans recall Frank's lacerating wit, whether it was directed at the Clinton impeachment ("What did the president touch, and when did he touch it?") or the pro-life movement (some people believe "life begins at conception and ends at birth"). But the contours of his private and public lives are less well-known. For more than four decades, he was at the center of the struggle for personal freedom and economic fairness. From the battle over AIDS funding in the 1980s to the debates over "big government" during the Clinton years to the 2008 financial crisis, the congressman from Massachusetts played a key role. In 2010, he coauthored the most far-reaching and controversial Wall Street reform bill since the era of the Great Depression, and helped bring about the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. <br> In this feisty and often moving memoir, Frank candidly discusses the satisfactions, fears, and grudges that come with elected office. He recalls the emotional toll of living in the closet and how his public crusade against homophobia conflicted with his private accommodation of it. He discusses his painful quarrels with allies; his friendships with public figures, from Tip O'Neill to Sonny Bono; and how he found love with his husband, Jim Ready, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to enter a same-sex marriage. He also demonstrates how he used his rhetorical skills to expose his opponents' hypocrisies and delusions. Through it all, he expertly analyzes the gifts a successful politician must bring to the job, and how even Congress can be made to work. <br><i> Frank</i> is the story of an extraordinary political life, an original argument for how to rebuild trust in government, and a guide to how political change really happens--composed by a master of the art.</p></p><p><b>Barney Frank</b> represented the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts for more than three decades and chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2007 to 2011.

By linking research ranging from the ancient Greek &#34;dream temples&#34; and modern experiments in telepathy, REM, and lucid dreaming to his own research on human consciousness, he theorizes that dreaming is the basis for consciousness, and that it is through dreaming that we are able to manifest a sense of ourselves.</p><p>Fred Alan Wolf, PH.D., is a consulting physicist, writer, and lecturer. He travels throughout the United States and the world lecturing on the new physics and consciousness and is the author of <i>The Eagle's Quest</i> and <i>Parallel Universes.</i> Wolf won the American Book Award for <i>Taking the Quantum Leap.</i> He lives near Seattle, Washington.New Age border-crossings that blur more than clarify where physics and the dreaming psyche meet. As in The Eagle Quest (1991), physicist Wolf extends Jung's idea of synchronicity to explain the connection between an individual's dream and the ``dreaming universe.'' He finds Freudian dream theory analogous to, and as limited as, Newtonian physics- -it's no surprise that Jung in turn is praised as being analogous to Niels Bohr, ``the father/mother of quantum physics.'' Reverting to ideas explored in Parallel Universes (1989), Wolf considers the ``essential mystery'' at the heart of quantum mechanics, using a variety of coyly autobiographical anecdotes to suggest that the dreaming brain, by entering the unconscious mind, is experiencing synchronicity. It's this kind of sloppy mixture of anecdotal and scientific material that keeps New Age thought on the fringe. It doesn't get any better when Wolf throws in superficial chapters on ancient views of dreams, the research of neurophysiologist Benjamin Libet, and Crick and Mitchison's theory that ``we dream in order to reduce faults by feeding in certain `unlearning' inputs that poisoned the unwanted modes.'' In each, the analogies are all simplistic and reductive. Wolf claims that dreams are ``an altered state of conscious awareness,'' equivalent to a ``quantum mechanics of dreaming.'' But his thinking is confused; sometimes he uses quantum physics as a model or a metaphor to understand dreams, but ultimately he wants to posit a world in which there is no outer world of space and time separated from the inner world of mental activity, but only a third ``imaginal realm...of the big dreamer.'' Subjectively anecdotal, dilettantish wish-fulfillment. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their task is to arrange the surrender of the Vichy French forces. But there is dissension between the regular army, the local militia, and De Gaulle&#x2019;s Free French. American black marketeers in league with the enemy divert medical supplies to the Casbah, leading to multiple murders that Billy must solve while trying to rescue the girl he loves, a captured British spy. <br><br> <b> <br> </b></p><p>James R. Benn is the author of Billy Boyle: A World War II Mystery and The First Wave, selected by Book Sense as one of the top five mysteries of 2006 and nominated for a Dilys award. He is a librarian and lives in Hadlyme, Connecticut.Like Mark Frost in The Second Objective (2007), Benn builds his Billy Boyle series around little-known snippets of World War II history: Billy Boyle (2006) concerned a proposed Allied invasion of Norway, and this time the focus is on Eisenhower&#39;s plan to invade Vichy-held Algeria, anticipating a quick surrender by the French. It doesn&#39;t happen quite like that, and along the way, Boyle, a special investigator with Eisenhower&#39;s staff, finds himself trying to solve a series of murders connected to black marketeers and working to rescue the captured British spy with whom he fell in love in the first book. The unusual premises are the best part of this series and will be certain to appeal to WWII fiction fans, though Benn continues to struggle with the nuts and bolts of character development and plotting. The identity of the Allied traitor is obvious early on, and the interpersonal relationships still fall prey to the kind of melodrama associated with WWII tearjerkers. Still, Benn is improving from book to book, and as his storytelling skills inch closer to his feel for the historical moment, this series could come into its own.

Taran, the taller horseman, set his face against the wind and leaned forward in the saddle, his eyes on the distant hills. At his belt hung a sword, and from his shoulder a silver-bound battle horn. His companion Gurgi, shaggier than the pony he rode, pulled his weathered cloak around him, rubbed his frost-nipped ears, and began groaning so wretchedly that Taran at last reined up the stallion. "No, no!" Gurgi cried. "Faithful Gurgi will keep on! He follows kindly master, oh yes, as he has always done. Never mind his shakings and achings! Never mind the droopings of his poor tender head!" Taran smiled, seeing that Gurgi, despite his bold words, was eyeing a sheltering grove of ash trees. "There is time to spare," he answered. "I long to be home, but not at the cost of that poor tender head of yours. We camp here and go no farther until morning." They tethered their mounts and built a small fire in a ring of stones. Gurgi curled up and was snoring almost before he had finished swallowing his food. Though as weary as his companion,Taran set about mending the harness leathers. Suddenly he stopped and jumped to his feet. Overhead, a winged shape plunged swiftly toward him. "Look!" Taran cried, as Gurgi, still heavy with sleep, sat up and blinked. "It's Kaw! Dallben must have sent him to find us." The crow beat his wings, clacked his beak, and began squawking loudly even before he landed on Taran's outstretched wrist. "Eilonwy!" Kaw croaked at the top of his voice. "Eilonwy! Princess! Home!" Taran's weariness fell from him like a cloak. Gurgi, wide awake and shouting joyfully, scurried to unloose the steeds. Taran leaped astride Melynlas, spun the gray stallion about, and galloped from the grove, with Kaw perched on his shoulder and Gurgi and the pony pounding at his heels. Day and night they rode, hardly halting for a mouthful of food or a moment of sleep, urging all speed and strength from their mounts and from themselves, ever southward, down from the mountain valley and across Great Avren until, on a bright morning, the fields of Caer Dallben lay before them once again. &nbsp; <br> From the instant Taran set foot across the threshold, such a commotion filled the cottage that he scarcely knew which way to turn. Kaw had immediately begun jabbering and flapping his wings; Coll, whose great bald crown and broad face shone with delight, was clapping Taran on the back; while Gurgi shouted in glee and leaped up and down in a cloud of shedding hair. Even the ancient enchanter Dallben, who seldom let anything disturb his meditations,hobbled out of his chamber to observe the welcomings. In the midst of it all, Taran could hardly glimpse Eilonwy, though he heard the voice of the Princess very clearly above the din. "Taran of Caer Dallben," she cried, as he strove to draw near her, "I've been waiting to see you for days! After all the time I've been away learning to be a young lady--as if I weren't one before I left--when I'm home at last, you're not even here!" In another moment he was at her side. The slender Princess still wore at her throat the crescent moon of silver, and on her finger the ring crafted by the Fair Folk. But now a band of gold circled her brow, and the richness of her apparel made Taran suddenly aware of his travel-stained cloak and muddy boots. "And if you think living in a castle is pleasant," Eilonwy went on, without a pause for breath, "I can tell you it isn't. It's weary and dreary! They've made me sleep in beds with goosefeather pillows enough to stifle you; I'm sure the geese needed them more than I did--the feathers, that is, not the pillows. And servitors to bring you exactly what you don't want to eat. And washing your hair whether it needs it or not. And sewing and weaving and curtsying and all such I don't even want to think about. I've not drawn a sword for I don't know how long ..." Eilonwy stopped abruptly and looked curiously at Taran. "That's odd," she said. "There's something different about you. It's not your hair, though it does look as if you'd cropped it yourself with your eyes shut. It's--well, I can't quite say. I mean, unless you told someone they'd never guess you were an Assistant Pig-Keeper." Taran laughed fondly at Eilonwy's puzzled frown. "Alas, it's beenlong since last I tended Hen Wen. Indeed, when we journeyed among the folk of the Free Commots, Gurgi and I toiled at nearly everything but pig-keeping. This cloak I wove at the loom of Dwyvach the Weaver-Woman; this sword--Hevydd the Smith taught me the forging of it. And this," he said with a trace of sadness, drawing an earthen bowl from his jacket, "such as it is, I made at the wheel of Annlaw Clay-Shaper." He put the bowl in her hands. "If it pleases you, it is yours." "It's lovely," answered Eilonwy. "Yes, I shall treasure it. But that's what I mean, too. I'm not saying you aren't a good Assistant Pig-Keeper, because I'm sure you're the best in Prydain, but there's something more--" "You speak truth, Princess," put in Coll. "He left us a pig-keeper and comes back looking as if he could do all he set his hand to, whatever." Taran shook his head. "I learned I was neither swordsmith nor weaver. Nor, alas, a shaper of clay. Gurgi and I were already homeward bound when Kaw found us, and here shall we stay." "I'm glad of that," replied Eilonwy. "All anyone knew about you was that you were wandering every which where. Dallben told me you were seeking your parents. Then you met someone you thought was your father but wasn't. Or was it the other way round? I didn't altogether understand it." "There is little to understand," Taran said. "What I sought, I found. Though it was not what I had hoped." "No, it was not," murmured Dallben, who had been watching Taran closely. "You found more than you sought, and gained perhaps more than you know." "I still don't see why you wanted to leave Caer Dallben," Eilonwy began. Taran had no chance to reply, for now his hand was seized and shaken vigorously. "Hullo, hullo!" cried a young man with pale blue eyes and strawcolored hair. His handsomely embroidered cloak looked as though it had been water-soaked, then wrung out to dry. His bootlacings, broken in several places, had been retied in large, straggling knots. "Prince Rhun!" Taran had almost failed to recognize him. Rhun had grown taller and leaner, though his grin was as broad as it had ever been. "King Rhun, actually," the young man answered, "since my father died last summer. That's one of the reasons why Princess Eilonwy is here now. My mother wanted to keep her with us on Mona to finish her education. And you know my mother! She'd never have left off with it, even though Dallben had sent word Eilonwy was to come home. And so," he proudly added, "I finally put my foot down. I ordered a ship fitted out, and off we sailed from Mona Haven. Amazing what a king can do when he sets his mind to it! "We've brought someone else along, too," Rhun continued, gesturing toward the fireside where Taran for the first time noticed a pudgy little man sitting with a cook-pot between his knees. The stranger licked his fingers and wrinkled a flabby nose at Taran. He made no attempt to rise, but only nodded curtly while the scraggly fringe of hair around his bulbous head stirred like weeds under water. Taran stared, not believing what he saw. The little man drewhimself up and sniffed with a mixture of haughtiness and wounded feelings. "One should have no trouble remembering a giant," he said testily. "Remember you?" replied Taran. "How could I not! The cavern on Mona! Last time I saw you, though, you were--bigger, to say the least. But it is you, nevertheless. It is, indeed! Glew!" "When I was a giant," Glew said, "few would have forgotten me so quickly. Unfortunate that things worked out as they did. Now, in the cavern--" "You've started him off again," Eilonwy whispered to Taran. "He'll go on like that until you're fairly wilted, about the glorious days when he used to be a giant. He'll only stop talking to eat, and only stop eating to talk. I can understand his eating, since he lived on nothing but mushrooms for so long. But he must have been wretched as a giant, and you'd think he'd want to forget it." "I knew Dallben sent Kaw with a potion to shrink Glew back to size," Taran answered. "Of what happened to him since then, I've had no word." " <i>That</i>'s what happened to him," said Eilonwy. "As soon as he got free of the cavern, he made his way to Rhun's castle. No one had the heart to turn him away, though he bored us all to tears with those endless pointless tales of his. We took him with us when we sailed, thinking he'd be grateful to Dallben and want to thank him properly. Not a bit of it! We almost had to twist his ears to get him aboard. Now that he's here, I wish we'd left him where he was." "But three of our companions are missing," Taran said, glancingaround the cottage. "Good old Doli, and Fflewddur Fflam. And I had hoped Prince Gwydion might have come to welcome Eilonwy." "Doli sends his best wishes," said Coll, "but we shall have to do without his company. Our dwarf friend is harder to root out of the Fair Folk realm than a stump out of a field. He'll not budge. As for Fflewddur Fflam, nothing can keep him and his harp from any merrymaking, whatever. He should have been here long since." "Prince Gwydion as well," Dallben added. "He and I have matters to discuss. Though you young people may doubt it, some of them are even weightier than the homecomings of a Princess and an Assistant Pig-Keeper." "Well, I shall put this on again when Fflewddur and Prince Gwydion arrive," said Eilonwy, taking the golden circlet from her brow, "just so they can see how it looks. But I won't wear it a moment longer. It's rubbed a blister and it makes my head ache--like someone squeezing your neck, only higher up." "Ah, Princess," Dallben said, with a furrowed smile, "a crown is more discomfort than adornment. If you have learned that, you have already learned much." "Learning!" Eilonwy declared. "I've been up to my ears in learning. It doesn't show, so it's hard to believe it's there. Wait, that's not quite true, either. Here, I've learned this." From her cloak she drew a large square of folded cloth and almost shyly handed it to Taran. "I embroidered it for you. It's not finished yet, but I wanted you to have it, even so. Though I admit it's not as handsome as the things you've made." Taran spread out the fabric. As broad as his outstretched arms, the somewhat straggle-threaded embroidery showed a white, blue-eyed pig against a field of green. "It's meant to be Hen Wen," Eilonwy explained as Rhun and Gurgi pressed forward to study the handiwork more closely. "At first, I tried to embroider you into it, too," Eilonwy said to Taran. "Because you're so fond of Hen and because--because I was thinking of you. But you came out looking like sticks with a bird's nest on top, not yourself at all. So I had to start over with Hen alone. You'll just have to make believe you're standing beside her, a little to the left. Otherwise, I'd never have got this much done, and I did work the summer on it." "If I was in your thoughts then," Taran said, "your work gladdens me all the more. No matter that Hen's eyes are really brown." Eilonwy looked at him in sudden dismay. "You don't like it." "I do, in all truth," Taran assured her. "Brown or blue makes no difference. It will be useful--" "Useful!" cried Eilonwy. "Useful's not the point! It's a keepsake, not a horse blanket! Taran of Caer Dallben, you don't understand anything at all." "At least," Taran replied, with a good-natured grin, "I know the color of Hen Wen's eyes." Eilonwy tossed her red-gold hair and put her chin in the air. "Humph!" she said. "And very likely forgotten the color of mine." "Not so, Princess," Taran answered quietly. "Nor have I forgotten when you gave me this," he added, taking up the battle horn. "Itspowers were greater than either of us knew. They are gone now, but I treasure it still because it came from your hands. "You asked why I sought to know my parentage," Taran went on. "Because I hoped it would prove noble, and give me the right to ask what I dared not ask before. My hope was mistaken. Yet even without it--" Taran hesitated, searching for the most fitting words. Before he could speak again, the cottage door burst open, and Taran cried out in alarm. At the threshold stood Fflewddur Fflam. The bard's face was ashen, his ragged yellow hair clung to his forehead. On his shoulder he bore the limp body of a man. Taran, with Rhun behind him, sprang to help. Gurgi and Eilonwy followed as they lowered the still figure to the ground. Glew, his pudgy cheeks quivering, stared speechless. At the first instant, Taran had nearly staggered at the shock. Now his hands worked quickly, almost of themselves, to unclasp the cloak and loosen the torn jacket. Before him, on the hard-packed earth, lay Gwydion Prince of Don. Blood crusted the warrior's wolf-gray hair and stained his weathered face. His lips were drawn back, his teeth set in battle rage. Gwydion's cloak muffled one arm as though at the last he had sought to defend himself with this alone. "Lord Gwydion is slain!" Eilonwy cried. "He lives--though barely," Taran said. "Fetch medicines," he ordered Gurgi. "The healing herbs from my saddlebags--" He stopped short and turned to Dallben. "Forgive me. It is not for me tocommand under my master's roof. But the herbs are of great power. Adaon Son of Taliesin gave them to me long ago. They are yours if you wish them." "I know their nature and have none that will serve better," Dallben answered. "Nor should you fear to command under any roof, since you have learned to command yourself. I trust your skill as I see you trust it. Do as you see fit." Coll was already hurrying from the scullery with water in a basin. Dallben, who had knelt at Gwydion's side, rose and turned to the bard. "What evil deed is this?" The old enchanter spoke hardly above a whisper, yet his voice rang through the cottage and his eyes blazed in anger. "Whose hand dared strike him?" "The Huntsmen of Annuvin," replied Fflewddur. "Two lives they almost claimed. How did you fare?" he urgently asked Taran. "How did you outride them so quickly? Be thankful it went no worse for you." Taran, puzzled, glanced up at the distraught bard. "Your words have no meaning, Fflewddur." "Meaning?" answered the bard. "They mean what they say. Gwydion would have traded his life for yours when the Huntsmen set upon you not an hour ago." "Set upon me?" Taran's perplexity grew. "How can that be? Gurgi and I saw no Huntsmen. And we have been at Caer Dallben this hour past." "Great Belin, a Fflam sees what he sees!" cried Fflewddur. "A fever is working in you," Taran...</p><h2>The Fiddle Book: The Comprehensive book on American folk music fiddling and fiddle styles, including more than 150 traditional fiddle tunes, compiled from country fiddlers</h2><p>The most comprehensive collection of traditional fiddle tunes ever compiled.

In the early 1970s, Ruscha began working with Cirrus Editions and Cirrus Gallery in Los Angeles, pursuing his interest in liquid words, unconventional ink substances (including chocolate, Pepto Bismol and caviar) and trompe l&#39;oeil imagery. Throughout his career Ruscha has worked in a wide range of media - photography, graphic design, painting, drawing, printmaking and film.

These are the words and melodies that are as familiar to us as the flag, so firmly ensconced in our mental topographies that they have become part of our standard literature, songs adopted and adapted by generations of performers, jazz singers, and musicians, deeply lodged in the memory of everyone who has ever heard them.<br><br>All the Things You Are, Star Dust, Over the Rainbow, Laura, Stormy Weather, Some Enchanted Evening, Someone to Watch Over Me, My Funny Valentine the tunes are as "easy to remember" as breathing, but how were they written? What stars and what shows were they written for? Who were the men and women who wrote them? What makes the songs so good? Zinsser answers these questions. Starting with Show Boat in 1927, he provides a comprehensive overview, telling his story through the lives and careers of the great composers and lyricists: Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein, George and Ira Gershwin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Dorothy Fields, Hoagy Carmichael, Johnny Mercer, Harry Warren, Jule Styne, Frank Loesser, Stephen Sondheim, and many more.<br><br>Zinsser writes from an intimate knowledge of the songs, as a scholar of the American musical theater, and as a pianist-performer himself. The result is a book unlike any other in its authority, insight, and detail. Written with the author's usual elegance and humor, supported by lyrics that instantly bring back the songs and their emotional associations, Easy to Remember is handsomely illustrated with rare photographs of the songwriters and with sheet music covers of the songs they wrote one of America's gaudiest forms of poster art. With indices, song lists, and an extensive bibliography for show-tune aficionados, this is going to be the standard bedside reference for anyone who has ever found themselves seduced by this great American art form.</p><p>William Zinsser is the author of On Writing Well and fifteen other books. His many writings on music include Mitchell &amp; Ruff, an acclaimed profile of the pianist Dwike Mitchell and the bassist Willie Ruff that is a masterpiece of jazz reportage and informal biography. He teaches at the New School in New York city, where he lives with his wife, Caroline Zinsser.Zinsser's enthusiasm for his subject emanates from the pages of this study of "the golden age of American popular song," framed by "the musical Show Boat in 1927... until the rise of rock in the mid-1960s." "My book doesn't claim to be definitive," writes Zinsser, theater and movie critic for The New York Herald Tribune during the '50s, professional piano player and author of 16 books, including On Writing Well and Mitchell &amp; Ruff; "it's just one man's tour of his collection, as idiosyncratic as another man's collection of stamps or coins or butterflies." Zinsser uses the biographies of major songwriting talents as centerpieces for his in-depth portrayal of the days when "every home seemed to have a piano and at least one member of the family who could play it." He includes chapters on sheet music, songs from WWII and the direct impact that vocalists, Hollywood stars (Fred Astaire) and movies (The Wizard of Oz) had on popular composers. Moving from the "agreeable world" of Hoagy Carmichael to "hit machines" like Harry Warren, to the ambitious works of Gershwin, Zinsser demonstrates their centrality in the sphere of American music. He discusses not only harmony, intervals and syncopation, but he also includes the humble stories of talents who strove for, stumbled upon or seized prominence. Despite Zinsser's personal enthusiasm, the work never veers into sentimentality. "My book is a celebration, not a funeral, and one of the miracles I'm celebrating is how powerfully the songs have become lodged in the nation's collective memory," Zinsser explains. His effort is worthy of his ambition. B &amp; w photographs and illustrations.

But what seems innovative, Eugene Genovese shows us, may in fact have very old roots. Tracing a certain strain of conservatism to its sources in a rich southern tradition, his book introduces a revealing perspective on the politics of our day. As much a work of political and moral philosophy as one of history, <i>The Southern Tradition</i> is based on the intellectual journey of one of the most influential historians of the late twentieth century. </p><p> To appreciate the tradition of southern conservatism, Genovese tells us, we must first understand the relation of southern thought to politics. Toward this end, he presents a historical overview that identifies the tenets, sensibilities, and attitudes of the southern-conservative world view. With these conditions in mind, he considers such political and constitutional issues as state rights, concurrent majority, and the nature and locus of political power in a constitutional republic. Of special interest are the southern-conservative critiques of equality and democracy, and of the Leviathan state in its liberal, socialist, and fascist forms. Genovese examines these critiques in light of the specific concept of property that has been central to southern social and political thought. </p><p> Not only does this book illuminate a political tradition grounded in the writings of John Randolph and John C. Calhoun, but it shows how this lineage has been augmented by powerful literary figures such as Allen Tate, Lewis Simpson, and Robert Penn Warren. Genovese here reconstitutes the historical canon, reenvisions the strengths and weaknesses of the conservative tradition, and broadens the spectrum of political debate for our time. </p></p><p>In recent years, American conservatism has found a new voice.

This all-new fourth edition has been revised from start to finish, featuring updated material that emphasizes independent midwifery, physiologic (natural) birth, and the art of nonintervention. Midwifery expert Elizabeth Davis includes valuable hints for turning breech and posterior babies, mediating pain in labor, and supporting newborn physiology. Davis also reveals the keys to postpartum recovery, with practical tips on breastfeeding for busy mothers. Comprehensive and compassionate, HEART &amp; HANDS remains a dog-eared classic for parents, midwives, and other birthing helpers.Thoroughly revised and updated fourth edition of the classic text for midwives, also useful for expecting parents, nurses, childbirth educators, doulas, and other labor helpers.Features new diagrams and photographs, updated midwifery forms, and an expanded resource list for parents.Expanded sections on GBS, VBAC, gestational diabetes, and water birth address current controversies.Previous editions have sold more than 150,000 copies. "An impressive and deeply caring book . . . reveals a shrewd and compassionate sensitivity to women'ï¿½?s needs in pregnancy and childbirth." -Sheila Kitzinger, author of <i>The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Birth</i></p><p>Elizabeth Davis's <i>Heart and Hands</i>, though subtitled <i>A Midwife's Guide to Pregnancy and Birth</i>, is not just for midwives. It's an excellent and thorough resource for parents-to-be who are thinking about delivering their child with a midwife, or who are concerned about the medical establishment's over-control of birth. (Two previous editions sold more than 100,000 copies and there are nowhere near 100,000 midwives or midwifery students to buy this book, proving that parents-to-be have looked to this resource for options.) <p> Completely updated in the third edition, <i>Heart and Hands</i> is a practical guide, textbook, and reference that is both hands- and hearts-on. Davis, a long-time, well-known midwife, gives how-to details on all aspects of midwifery practice, including prenatal care, problems in pregnancy, assisting at births, labor complications (including a devastating and beautiful description of a stillbirth by midwife Shannon Anton), and caring for the entire family postpartum. Each chapter has a special section "for parents," but expectant parents can use all of <i>Heart and Hands</i> to get as much knowledge as possible about their upcoming experience.</p>* Thoroughly revised and updated fourth edition of the classic text for midwives, also useful for expecting parents, nurses, childbirth educators, doulas, and other labor helpers. <p>* Features new diagrams and photographs, updated midwifery forms, and an expanded resource list for parents. </p><p>* Expanded sections on GBS, VBAC, gestational diabetes, and water birth address current controversies. </p><p>* Previous editions have sold more than 150,000 copies</p></p><h2>Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry: The Deception Behind Indigenous Cultural Preservation</h2><p>By examining the root causes of aboriginal problems, Frances Widdowson and Albert Howard expose the industry that has grown up around land claim settlements, showing that aboriginal policy development over the past thirty years has been manipulated by non-aboriginal lawyers and consultants. They analyse all the major aboriginal policies, examine issues that have received little critical attention - child care, health care, education, traditional knowledge - and propose the comprehensive government provision of health, education, and housing rather than deficient delivery through Native self-government.</p><p>CA&#34;Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry does an excellent job of pointing out logical inconsistencies in the Aboriginal political movement - a matter of great practical as well as academic importance.&#34; Tom Flanagan, author of First Nations?

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br>Cade Parris wasn't having the best of days when the woman of his dreams walked into his office. His secretary had quit the day before&#x2014;not that she'd been much of a prize anyway, being more vigilant about her manicure than maintaining the phone logs. But he needed someone to keep track of things and shuffle papers into files. Even the raise he offered out of sheer desperation hadn't swayed her to give up her sudden determination to become a country-and-western singing sensation.<p>So his secretary was heading off to Nashville in a second-hand pickup, and his office looked like the ten miles of bad road he sincerely hoped she traveled.</p><p>She hadn't exactly had her mind on her work the past month or two. That impression had been more than confirmed when he fished a bologna sandwich out of the file drawer. At least he thought the blob in the plastic bag was bologna. And it had been filed under L&#x2014;for Lunch?</p><p>He didn't bother to swear, nor did he bother to answer the phone that rang incessantly on the empty desk in his reception area. He had reports to type up, and as typing wasn't one of his finer skills, he just wanted to get on with it.</p><p>Parris Investigations wasn't what some would call a thriving enterprise. But it suited him, just as the cluttered two-room office squeezed into the top floor of a narrow brick building with bad plumbing in North West D.C. suited him.</p><p>He didn't need plush carpets or polished edges. He'd grown up with all that, with the pomp and pretenses, and had had his fill of it all by the time he reached the age of twenty. Now, at thirty, with one bad marriage behind him and a family who continued to be baffled by his pursuits, he was, by and large, a contented man.</p><p>He had his investigator's license, a decent reputation as a man who got the job done, and enough income to keep his agency well above water.</p><p>Though actual business income was a bit of a problem just then. He was in what he liked to call a lull. Most of his caseload consisted of insurance and domestic work&#x2014;a few steps down from the thrills he'd imagined when he set out to become a private investigator. He'd just cleaned up two cases, both of them minor insurance frauds that hadn't taken much effort or innovation to close.</p><p>He had nothing else coming in, his greedy blood-sucker of a landlord was bumping up his rent, the engine in his car had been making unsettling noises lately, his air conditioner was on the fritz. And the roof was leaking again.</p><p>He took the spindly yellow-leafed philodendron his double-crossing secretary had left behind and set it on the uncarpeted floor under the steady drip, hoping it might drown.</p><p>He could hear a voice droning into his answering machine. It was his mother's voice. Lord, he thought, did a man ever really escape his mother?</p><p>"Cade, dear, I hope you haven't forgotten the Embassy Ball. You know you're to escort Pamela Lovett. I had lunch with her aunt today, and she tells me that Pamela just looks marvelous after her little sojourn to Monaco."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah," he muttered, and narrowed his eyes at the computer. He and machines had poor and untrusting relationships.</p><p>He sat down and faced the screen as his mother continued to chatter: "Have you had your tux cleaned? Do make time to get a haircut, you looked so scraggly the last time I saw you."</p><p>And don't forget to wash behind the ears, he thought sourly, and tuned her out. She was never going to accept that the Parris life-style wasn't his life-style, that he just didn't want to lunch at the club or squire bored former debutantes around Washington and that his opinion wasn't going to change by dint of her persuasion.</p><p>He'd wanted adventure, and though struggling to type up a report on some poor slob's fake whiplash wasn't exactly Sam Spade territory, he was doing the job.</p><p>Mostly he didn't feel useless or bored or out of place. He liked the sound of traffic outside his window, even though the window was only open because the building and its scum-sucking landlord didn't go in for central air-conditioning and his unit was broken. The heat was intense, and the rain was coming in, but with the window closed, the offices would have been as airless and stifling as a tomb.</p><p>Sweat rolled down his back, making him itchy and irritable. He was stripped down to a T-shirt and jeans, his long fingers fumbling a bit on the computer keys. He had to shovel his hair out of his face several times, which ticked him off. His mother was right. He needed a haircut.</p><p>So when it got in the way again, he ignored it, as he ignored the sweat, the heat, the buzz of traffic, the steady drip from the ceiling. He sat, methodically punching a key at a time, a remarkably handsome man with a scowl on his face.</p><p>He'd inherited the Parris looks&#x2014;the clever green eyes that could go broken-bottle sharp or as soft as sea mist, depending on his mood. The hair that needed a trim was dark mink brown and tended to wave. Just now, it curled at his neck, over his ears, and was beginning to annoy him. His nose was straight, aristocratic and a little long, his mouth firm and quick to smile when he was amused. And to sneer when he wasn't.</p><p>Though his face had become more honed since the embarrassing cherubic period of his youth and early adolescence, it still sported dimples. He was looking forward to middle age, when, with luck, they'd become manly creases.</p><p>He'd wanted to be rugged, and instead was stuck with the slick, dreamy good looks of a GQ cover&#x2014;for one of which he'd posed in his middle twenties, under protest and great family pressure.</p><p>The phone rang again. This time he heard his sister's voice, haranguing him about missing some lame cocktail party in honor of some big-bellied senator she was endorsing.</p><p>He thought about just ripping the damn answering machine out of the wall and heaving it, and his sister's nagging voice, out the window into the traffic on Wisconsin Avenue.</p><p>Then the rain that was only adding to the miserably thick heat began to drip on the top of his head. The computer blinked off, for no reason he could see other than sheer nastiness, and the coffee he'd forgotten he was heating boiled over with a spiteful hiss.</p><p>He leaped up, burned his hand on the pot. He swore viciously as the pot smashed, shattering glass, and spewing hot coffee in all directions. He ripped open a drawer, grabbed for a stack of napkins and sliced his thumb with the lethal edge of his former&#x2014;and now thoroughly damned to perdition&#x2014;secretary's nail file.</p><p>When the woman walked in, he was still cursing and bleeding and had just tripped over the philodendron set in the middle of the floor and didn't even look up.</p><p>It was hardly a wonder she simply stood there, damp from the rain, her face pale as death and her eyes wide with shock.</p><p>"Excuse me." Her voice sounded rusty, as if she hadn't used it in days. "I must have the wrong office." She inched backward, and those big, wide brown eyes shifted to the name printed on the door. She hesitated, then looked back at him. "Are you Mr. Parris?"</p><p>There was a moment, one blinding moment, when he couldn't seem to speak. He knew he was staring at her, couldn't help himself. His heart simply stood still.</p><p>His knees went weak. And the only thought that came to his mind was There you are, finally. What the hell took you so long?</p><p>And because that was so ridiculous, he struggled to put a bland, even cynical, investigator's expression on his face.</p><p>"Yeah." He remembered the handkerchief in his pocket, and wrapped it over his busily bleeding thumb.</p><p>"Just had a little accident here."</p><p>"I see." Though she didn't appear to, the way she continued to stare at his face. "I've come at a bad time. I don't have an appointment. I thought maybe..."</p><p>"Looks like my calendar's clear."</p><p>He wanted her to come in, all the way in. Whatever that first absurd, unprecedented reaction of his, she was still a potential client. And surely no dame who ever walked through Sam Spade's hallowed door had ever been more perfect.</p><p>She was blond and beautiful and bewildered. Her hair was wet, sleek down to her shoulders and straight as the rain. Her eyes were bourbon brown, in a face that&#x2014; though it could have used some color&#x2014;was delicate as a fairy's. It was heart-shaped, the cheeks a gentle curve and the mouth was full, unpainted and solemn.</p><p>She'd ruined her suit and shoes in the rain. He recognized both as top-quality, that quietly exclusive look found only in designer salons. Against the wet blue silk of her suit, the canvas bag she clutched with both hands looked intriguingly out of place.</p><p>Damsel in distress, he mused, and his lips curved. Just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>"Why don't you come in, close the door, Miss...?" </p><p>Her heart bumped twice, hammer-hard, and she tightened her grip on the bag. "You're a private investigator?"</p><p>"That's what it says on the door." Cade smiled again, ruthlessly using the dimples while he watched her gnaw that lovely lower lip. Damned if he wouldn't like to gnaw on it himself.</p><p>And that response, he thought with a little relief, was a lot more like it. Lust was a feeling he could understand.</p><p>"Let's go back to my office." He surveyed the damage&#x2014;broken glass, potting soil, pools of coffee. "I think I'm finished in here for now."</p><p>"All right." She took a deep breath, stepped in, then closed the door. She supposed she had to start somewhere.</p><p>Picking her way over the debris, she followed him into the adjoining room. It was furnished with little more than a desk and a couple of bargain-basement chairs. Well, she couldn't be choosy about decor, she reminded herself. She waited until he'd sat behind his desk, tipped back in his chair and smiled at her again in that quick, trust-me way.</p><p>"Do you&#x2014; Could I&#x2014;" She squeezed her eyes tight, centered herself again. "Do you have some credentials I could see?"</p><p>More intrigued, he took out his license, handed it to her. She wore two very lovely rings, one on each hand, he noticed. One was a square-cut citrine in an antique setting, the other a trio of colored stones. Her earrings matched the second ring, he noted when she tucked her hair behind ...</p></p><h2>Sleep Like a Baby: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, 10)</h2><p><p>In <i>Sleep Like a Baby</i>, the latest installment of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling Charlaine Harris&#x2019;s Aurora Teagarden series, Robin and Aurora have finally begun their adventure in parenting.

Ever since discovering the literary form in the "Quotable Quotes" section of <i>Reader's Digest </i>when he was a child, he has been compiling them. Given his level of passion, it's fitting that he has penned what is probably the definitive work on aphorisms, a love letter&#x2013; cum&#x2013;memoir disguised as a reference book. It also explains why he occasionally gets so carried away that he describes Nietzsche as "the Evil [sic] Knievel of nineteenth-century philosophy" and Frenchman Joseph Joubert as "the great apostle of the aphorism." But Geary, deputy editor of the European edition of <i>Time </i>magazine, is also a veteran newsman, and for the most part he tones down the hype. He provides a useful definition&#x2014;an aphorism is brief, definitive, personal, philosophical and must have a twist&#x2014;along with lively thumbnail sketches of some of the masters of the form, among them Ludwig Wittgenstein and Mark Twain, "who deliberately set out to overturn [Benjamin] Franklin's friendly, avuncular sayings with his own darker, more ornery aphorisms." Geary's enthusiasm may overwhelm as much as it enlightens, but fellow fanatics will be delighted. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some consider Reilly a real-life James Bond, but his resume more closely resembles that of a Bond villain, or perhaps Sherlock Holmes's nemesis, Moriarty: a "diplomatic businessman," as one colleague described him, he crisscrossed the globe, brokering information and facilitating arms deals, always maintaining, as Spence, a professor of history at the University of Idaho, puts it, "a foot in all camps and access to the right people and information." Even his interest in Russia, especially after the 1917 revolution, may have stemmed from a desire to get in on the action should the country be opened up to foreign investment. Spence's biography covers a remarkable amount of territory, using newly released material in the British and Russian intelligence archives, but the dense narrative is frequently overwhelmed by the amount of detail. It becomes difficult to keep track of which alias Reilly is using at any given time, and the names of his colleagues blur together. In addition, Spence often relies on conjecture, about everything from Reilly's hypothetical involvement in several bombings in major American cities to the mysterious circumstances of his alleged capture and execution by the Soviets in 1925 (including persistent rumors placing him in Shanghai 13 years later). The historical aspects of the story are engrossing, but readers expecting a gripping espionage thriller will be let down by the scholarly tone and ambiguity. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc....exhaustive research...into his revealing story...(an) international stew of greed, double dealing and conflicts of interest... -- <i>W.

How would you like to "full-close" with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining book <i>The Game</i>. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like "half a man." That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup "community," a man named Mystery. <p> Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the "three-second rule"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like "Do you think magic spells work?" or "Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile. </p><p> After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still, <i>The Game</i> is a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p><p>Neil Strauss is the author of the<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Game, Rules of the Game, Emergency,</em> and<em> Everyone Loves You When You&#x2019;re Dead</em>.

Green (better known as Ranger Doug from the Grammy-award-winning group Riders In The Sky) is uniquely suited to write the story of the singing cowboy. He has been collecting information and interviews on western music, films, and performers for nearly thirty years. In this volume, he traces this history from the early days of vaudeville and radio, through the heyday of movie westerns before World War II, to the current revival.</p><p>Douglas B. Green is a music historian and performer. As Ranger Doug (the Idol of American Youth), he founded Riders in The Sky, the premier western group of the modern era.These two books explore the Western film genre, which is almost as old as the movie medium itself. In Cowboy, George-Warren (How the West Was Worn) offers a loving, well-illustrated tribute to the Western and its lore, from dime novels to Stetson hats. As the author points out, the connection between the Hollywood Western and reality was often a bit tenuous. Cowgirls, singing cowboys, and matinee idols (including unlikely figures like Cagney and Bogart) may have ruled the box office, but directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Anthony Mann brought mythmaking, spectacle, and hard-edged realism to the genre. Westerns peaked in popularity in the 1950s and 1960s and have rarely appeared since on television or at the multiplex. Cowboy certainly doesn't break any new ground, but George-Warren provides a glimpse of what we have lost, and public library patrons are likely to enjoy the nostalgic text and pictures. Music historian Green, also a member of Western swing group Riders in the Sky, resurrects a nearly forgotten era in his thorough history of the singing cowboy. Singing cowboys were numerous, but only a few, notably Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and Tex Ritter, achieved lasting success. However, as the author notes, even after Hollywood lost interest, singing cowboys influenced country music and regional television. Singing cowboys have enjoyed a modest revival on stage and records in recent years, though it seems the tradition in Hollywood has ridden into the sunset permanently. Cowboy is recommended for all public libraries, while Singing should find a place in large country music and film collections.<br><i>Stephen Rees, Levittown Regional Lib., PA </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Inquisition and Medieval Society: Power, Discipline, and Resistance in Languedoc</h2><p><p>James B. Given analyzes the inquisition in one French region in order to develop a sociology of medieval politics. Established in the early thirteenth century to combat widespread popular heresy, inquisitorial tribunals identified, prosecuted, and punished heretics and their supporters. The inquisition in Languedoc was the best documented of these tribunals because the inquisitors aggressively used the developing techniques of writing and record keeping to build cases and extract confessions.</p><p>Using a Marxist and Foucauldian approach, Given focuses on three inquiries: what techniques of investigation, interrogation, and punishment the inquisitors worked out in the course of their struggle against heresy; how the people of Languedoc responded to the activities of the inquisitors; and what aspects of social organization in Languedoc either facilitated or constrained the work of the inquisitors. Punishments not only inflicted suffering and humiliation on those condemned, he argues, but also served as theatrical instruction for the rest of society about the terrible price of transgression. Through a careful pursuit of these inquires, Given elucidates medieval society's contribution to the modern apparatus of power.</p></p><p><p>James B.

WHEN General Crook received orders to go out to Arizona and assume command of that savage-infested Department, he at once obeyed the order, and reached his new post of duty without baggage and without fuss. All the baggage he had would not make as much compass as a Remington type-writer. The only thing with him which could in any sense be classed as superfluous was a shotgun, but without this or a rifle he never travelled anywhere. He came, as I say, without the slightest pomp or parade, and without any one in San Francisco, except his immediate superiors, knowing of his departure, and without a soul in Tucson, not even the driver of the stage which had carried him and his baggage, knowing of his arrival. There were no railroads, there were no telegraphs in Arizona, and Crook was the last man in the world to seek notoriety had they existed. His whole idea of life was to do each duty well, and to let his work speak for itself. He arrived in the morning, went up to the residence of his old friend, Governor Safford, with whom he lunched, and before sundown every officer within the limits of what was then called the southern district of Arizona was under summons to report to him; that is, if the orders had not reached them they were on the way. From each he soon extracted all he knew about the country, the lines of travel, the trails across the various mountains, the fords where any were required for the streams, the nature of the soil, especially its products, such as grasses, character of the climate, the condition of the pack-mules, and all pertaining to them, and eve...</p><p>"Among the ten best Western books of all time.

At the height of his fame in 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming its youngest winner. His influence on major figures&#x2014;including Freud and William James&#x2014;was pervasive and profound. But in recent decades Kipling&#x2019;s reputation has suffered a strange eclipse. Though his body of work still looms large, and his monumental poem &#x201c;If&#x2014;&#x201d; is quoted and referenced by politicians, athletes, and ordinary readers alike, his unabashed imperialist views have come under increased scrutiny. In <i>If</i>, scholar Christopher Benfey brings this fascinating and complex writer to life and, for the first time, gives full attention to Kipling's intense engagement with the United States&#x2014;a rarely discussed but critical piece of evidence in our understanding of this man and his enduring legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Benfey traces the writer&#x2019;s deep involvement with America over one crucial decade, from 1889 to 1899, when he&nbsp;lived for four years in Brattleboro, Vermont, and sought deliberately to turn himself into a specifically American writer. It was his most prodigious and creative period, as well as his happiest, during which he wrote&nbsp;<i>The Jungle Book</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Captains Courageous</i>. Had a family dispute not forced his departure, Kipling almost certainly would have stayed. Leaving&nbsp;was the hardest thing he ever had to do, Kipling said. &#x201c;There are only two places in the world where I want to live,&#x201d; he lamented, &#x201c;Bombay and Brattleboro. And I can&#x2019;t live in either.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this&nbsp;fresh examination of Kipling,&nbsp;Benfey hangs a provocative &#x201c;what if&#x201d; over Kipling&#x2019;s American years and maps the imprint Kipling left on his adopted country as well as the imprint the country left on him.&nbsp;<i>If</i> proves there is relevance and magnificence to be found in Kipling&#x2019;s work.</p><p><b>Christopher Benfey</b> is Mellon Professor of English at Mount Holyoke College. A frequent contributor to&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>, he has held fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Council of Learned Societies. Benfey has written four books about the American Gilded Age including&nbsp;<i>A Summer of Hummingbirds</i>, which won the Christian Gauss Award of Phi Beta Kappa. He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts."Benfey eloquently argues not only that Kipling&#x2019;s engagement with the United States made him the writer he became, but that he lavishly returned the favor. . . Benfey reminds us of our debt to a category-demolishing, globe-striding man who indeed contained multitudes, the author of an immortal ode to equanimity.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;<b>&#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></b><br><br>&#x201c;Benfey tells it well, catching nuances that some biographers have missed. He argues that Kipling was profoundly altered by his experience of America, and that America, in turn, was altered by its experience of Kipling.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><b>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i></b></b><br><br>&#x201c;These years were joyous and then dire ones for Kipling, and Mr. Benfey recounts it all with a fine touch.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;<b><b>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</i></b></b></b><br><br><b>&#x201c;</b>[Benfey] draws on correspondence, memoirs and &#x2018;patterns of suggestion and implication&#x2019; in poems, essays and stories to assess the impact of Kipling&#x2019;s decadelong sojourn in the United States on his literary legacy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mount Holyoke professor and Amherst resident Christopher Benfey&#x2019;s focused and illuminating new biography of Kipling, I<i>f: The Untold Story of Kipling&#x2019;s American Years</i> (Penguin), looks at the decade Kipling spent in New England, calling these years &#x201c;the key creative period in his entire career.&#x201d; Kipling&#x2019;s literary luminance was unparalleled (he won the Nobel Prize in 1907 at age 41); but with the rise of post-colonialism, Kipling&#x2019;s reputation began to shift, and he fell out of favor, understood as 'a jingoist of Bard of Empire, a man on the wrong side of history.' Benfey, whose award-winning <i>A Summer of Hummingbirds</i>&nbsp;(Penguin) looked at the intersection of Dickinson, Twain, Stowe, and Martin Johnson Heade, steers his attention here on the ways in which the United States impacted the author, and the ways the author impacted the United States, arguing that Kipling&#x2019;s influence spanned literature and politics, and altered perceptions of masculinity and the supernatural. Benfey does a masterful job detangling a complex figure.&#x201d;<b> <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;</b><i>Boston Globe</i><br>&nbsp;<br></b>&#x201c;Rudyard Kipling is considered a British literary icon, but between 1889 and 1899, he lived in the United States.

He had traveled throughout Europe, been sold as a war captive in Turkey, escaped, and returned to England in time to join the Virginia Company's colonizing project. In Jamestown migrants, merchants, and soldiers who had also sailed to the distant shores of the Ottoman Empire, Africa, and Ireland in search of new beginnings encountered Indians who already possessed broad understanding of Europeans. Experience of foreign environments and cultures had sharpened survival instincts on all sides and aroused challenging questions about human nature and its potential for transformation. </p><p> It is against this enlarged temporal and geographic background that Jamestown dramatically emerges in Karen Kupperman's breathtaking study. Reconfiguring the national myth of Jamestown's failure, she shows how the settlement's distinctly messy first decade actually represents a period of ferment in which individuals were learning how to make a colony work. Despite the settlers' dependence on the Chesapeake Algonquians and strained relations with their London backers, they forged a tenacious colony that survived where others had failed. Indeed, the structures and practices that evolved through trial and error in Virginia would become the model for all successful English colonies, including Plymouth. </p><p> Capturing England's intoxication with a wider world through ballads, plays, and paintings, and the stark reality of Jamestown--for Indians and Europeans alike--through the words of its inhabitants as well as archeological and environmental evidence, Kupperman re-creates these formative years with astonishing detail. </p></p><p><b>Karen Ordahl Kupperman</b> is Silver Professor of History at New York University.Reviewed by Tony Horwitz<p>All memory is selective, for nations as for individuals. The year 1620 is etched into Plymouth Rock and the minds of most Americans as the birth date of this country. We hallow austere Pilgrims with a day of national gluttony. The Mayflower is iconic -- the name of a moving company, a luxury Washington hotel, and a recent best-seller.</p><p>But can you name the three ships that landed English colonists 13 years before the Pilgrims? Identify one person aboard, other than John Smith? Explain why they came and what happened to them?</p><p>Jamestown's 400th birthday arrives this year with a fleet of books to stir Americans from their historical amnesia. This awakening should be a snap. The saga of early Virginia has knights, knaves, shipwrecks, naked Indian dancers (cooing to sex-starved Englishmen, "Love you not me?" ),and plenty of smoking and drinking. It's pulp nonfiction compared to the family-friendly tale of pious Pilgrims dining with gentle Indians.</p><p> But the tawdry side of Jamestown also helps explain why its founding has rarely been enshrined as the nativity of English America. As Karen Ordahl Kupperman observes in The Jamestown Project, "This is the creation story from hell." Instead of Thanksgiving, there's the spectacle of starved colonists eating rats, shoes, excrement and each other. One man even killed, carved up and salted his pregnant wife. He was promptly tortured and executed, like many others at Jamestown, a settlement plagued by crime, mutiny and indolence. Rather than grow food, colonists extorted it from Indians. The English ultimately thrived by exporting tobacco and importing Africans. Small wonder that Americans have traditionally abridged Jamestown's story to a single scene: Pocahontas's romantic rescue of John Smith.</p><p> Several new Jamestown books provide a much fuller and less sanitized picture. Together, they tell an epic of suffering -- by English, Indians and Africans -- that was fateful not only to the survival of a colonial fort but to the character of a future nation. Unfortunately, none of these books is likely to excite interest in Jamestown to match that aroused for Plymouth by Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower. The Pilgrims, for now, appear safe atop their undeserved perch.</p><p> Kupperman, a historian at New York University and author of several fine books on early America, looks across centuries and continents to set Virginia in context as just one among dozens of colonial ventures. Her wide-angle approach illuminates the roots of European expansion and shows how colonization was understood by both the intruders and the intruded-upon. But it drains Jamestown's story of color and tension. Two hundred pages elapse before Kupperman starts narrating the events that followed the colonists' arrival in Virginia in 1607. Her retelling is tepid, as is her conclusion: "The key to building English societies abroad, however messy and incomplete, was discovered in Virginia and all successful colonies henceforth followed its model." </p><p>As its title suggests, Benjamin Woolley's Savage Kingdom (forthcoming in April) wants to grab the general reader by the throat. If Kupperman's book suffers from too little drama, Woolley's has too much. "On a cold January day in 1606, a messenger walked inconspicuously across the cobbles of London's Strand," a typical chapter opens. The short walk, we're told, was a journey that "crossed from one era of history to another." Only later do we learn the messenger's mission: delivering a dry document about the financing of colonization.</p><p> Woolley, a London-based journalist, has done prodigious research. But too often he improves on it, not only by injecting doubtful atmospherics but also by papering over critical historical questions. John Smith wrote several different versions of his capture by Indians and rescue by Pocahontas, casting doubt on the story's veracity and on Smith as a narrator generally. Woolley blends Smith's various accounts to give us the legendary tale, as if told by the captain around a campfire. He doesn't disclose this cut-and-paste job, except in an oblique footnote. Nor does he examine the meaning of the rescue or analyze almost any aspect of Jamestown's history -- a messy chronicle that cries out for authorial guidance.</p><p> Tim Hashaw provides plenty of direction in The Birth of Black America, which tells of the "Black Mayflower" that brought Africans to Jamestown in 1619. Shipped from Angola, then pirated from a Portuguese slaver, the Africans faced a mixed future in Virginia, which hadn't yet codified slavery. Some were enslaved for life; others became indentured servants, like poor whites, laboring for a term of years before winning back their freedom. A few eventually prospered; one family founded a large property called Angola.</p><p> Hashaw, an investigative journalist, makes the most of the scant material on Virginia's first Africans. But he dilutes this neglected story by chasing after a big-time scoop, alleging a conspiracy tying the Africans' arrival to the Pilgrims' departure. His detective work is hard to follow and detracts from the tragedy and import of the Black Mayflower. Just a month before the Africans were sold near Jamestown, colonists gathered to form the first representative assembly in English America. Already, in 1619, a year before the Pilgrims landed, America's founding flaw was evident. A society built on the contrary pillars of freedom and bondage was destined to fracture.</p><p> Jamestown was also seminal to the future nation because it unleashed one of the most exceptional and prophetic figures in American history. John Smith claimed that he "loved actions more then wordes," but 800 pages of the latter are collected in a mammoth volume from the Library of America that includes his writings, as well as other early narratives of English settlements.</p><p> Here you can read not only about Pocahontas -- whom Smith, contrary to Disney's Barbie-doll animation, described as "a child of tenne yeares olde" -- but also about the captain's incredible adventures on four continents. By the time he sailed for America, at the age of 27, Smith had roamed Europe, Asia and Africa as a mercenary, hermit, slave, pirate, fireworks expert and gladiator.</p><p> Smith was also a vivid writer, hurling invective at the English gentry ("Gluttonous Loyterers," "Tuftaffaty humorists," "tender educats") and delivering proto-American aphorisms ("who would not work must not eat"). But Smith's greatest contribution was his vision of "abounding America" as a land of opportunity for striving immigrants. "Here every man may be master of his owne labour and land," Smith wrote, so long as settlers were willing to work patiently at humble tasks such as farming and fishing. The first to heed his advice were the Pilgrims, who settled a region Smith had scouted six years before the Mayflower's landing and had christened "New England." </p><p>Extracting the gems from Smith's writing requires patient labor, too. His prose is disorganized, his elliptical sentences impossible to parse, and his spelling and syntax so erratic that English can seem a foreign language. The Library of America doesn't help; like its other compilations, this one has no introduction, and the textual notes are stuck at the back. For readers with access to a good library, Philip Barbour's well-annotated, three-volume The Complete Works of Captain John Smith (1986) remains the gold standard. Alternatively, there are short anthologies, including The Journals of Captain John Smith (new this year and edited by John Thompson) and Kupperman's Captain John Smith (1988), which is excellently edited and introduced.</p><p> Still, it's handy to have Smith's complete writing in one volume, and the Library of America edition also includes the best dispatches by other early English settlers in Virginia. These accounts, like Smith's, convey the rich and under-appreciated story of pre-Mayflower America. But the captain deserves the last word. "I would yet begin againe with as small meanes as I did at first," he wrote in 1624, as others followed the path he'd pioneered. "For all their discoveries," he observed, "are but Pigs of my owne Sow." </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

(Jewish Encounters Series)</h2><p><p><b>Part of the Jewish Encounter series<br><br></b><i>&#x201c;What is hateful unto you, do not do unto your neighbor. That is the whole Torah, all the rest is commentary. Now, go and study.&#x201d;<br></i>&nbsp;<br>This is the most famous teaching of Hillel, one of the greatest rabbis of the Talmudic era. What makes it so extraordinary is that it was offered to a gentile seeking conversion. Joseph Telushkin feels that this Talmudic story has great relevance for us today. At a time when religiosity is equated with ritual observance alone, when few Jews seem concerned with bringing Jewish teachings into the world, and when more than 40 percent of Jews intermarry, Judaism is in need of more of the openness that Hillel possessed two thousand years ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hillel&#x2019;s teachings, stories, and legal rulings can be found throughout the Talmud; many of them share his emphasis on ethical and moral living as an essential element in Jewish religious practice, including his citing the concept of <i>tikkun olam </i>(repairing the world) as a basis for modifying Jewish law. Perhaps the most prominent rabbi and teacher in the Land of Israel during the reign of Herod, Hillel may well have influenced Jesus, his junior by several decades. In a provocative analysis of both Judaism and Christianity, Telushkin reveals why Hillel&#x2019;s teachings about ethics as God&#x2019;s central demand and his willingness to encourage the process of conversion began to be ignored in favor of the stricter and less inclusive teachings of his rabbinic adversary, Shammai.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here is a bold new look at an iconic religious leader.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Telushkin</b> is the author of sixteen books, including <i>Jewish Literacy, The Book of Jewish Values, </i>and <i>A Code of Jewish Ethics, </i>the first volume of which received a National Jewish Book Award in 2006.

He lives in New York City.</p><p><b><i>Introduction </i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>I was sitting with a rabbinic friend swapping stories about our lives and our work. He started talking about an encounter he recently had: &#x201c;A Jewish man, probably in his early thirties, and his non-Jewish girlfriend came to speak with me. They want to marry, but his parents are dead set against their only son marrying a Gentile. I asked the woman what she thought about the parents&#x2019; attitude, and she was honest. She said it seemed primitive and ridiculous. But she also said that, if necessary, she&#x2019;d be willing to convert. After all, she wants to be a good person, and Judaism, she assumes, wants people to be good and might well have something to teach her about goodness. That&#x2019;s how she put it, &#x2018;might well have something to teach her about goodness.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what did you tell her?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&nbsp;<br>My friend, a rather traditional rabbi, answered: &#x201c;I told her that we&#x2019;re in no rush to bring people in, that conversion to Judaism is a not a quick business: &#x2018;Presto, you&#x2019;re a Jew.&#x2019; There&#x2019;s a lot to study, a lot of rituals to learn, and I certainly can&#x2019;t convert you before you do all that studying and commit yourself to practicing all that you study.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what did she say to that?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was the boyfriend who spoke up. He seemed really annoyed. &#x2018;I told you this was pointless,&#x2019; he said to the girl, and then he turned to me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting married in six weeks, Rabbi. With or without your help.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>My friend shrugged. &#x201c;I told them that even if the two of them had come in with a more open attitude, six weeks was way too quick to do a conversion. Six months would be a stretch. They walked out with a book I gave them, but they&#x2019;re not coming back, I can tell.&#x201d; My friend shook his head a few times, his expression a mixture of sadness and annoyance. &#x201c;What I was really thinking was that they&#x2019;d be better off going to city hall and just getting their license. We don&#x2019;t need converts like that. One day, if she&#x2019;s interested in becoming a real Jew, she can come see me.&#x201d; He shrugged and regarded my skeptical face. &#x201c;I know, I know, that day&#x2019;s never going to come.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>I was quiet a minute, thinking about, of all things, a Talmudic sage who lived two thousand years ago named Hillel, and about an American-Jewish community that&#x2019;s been getting smaller and smaller, and whose members have been intermarrying at a rate of 40 percent and higher for more than thirty years. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What about that comment she made to you?&#x201d; I finally asked him. <br>&nbsp;<br>He looked puzzled. &#x201c;Which comment?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That Judaism might well have something to teach her about being a good person.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nice words,&#x201d; he conceded. &#x201c;But I would have been a little more encouraged if she had actually said something about religion. Like maybe she had read about Shabbat and wanted to observe it. Or she was willing to keep kosher. At least then I would have felt that I had something to work with. But this couple gave me nothing to work with.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Nothing to work with. His words reverberated in my head. <br>&nbsp;<br>At the time, I had already begun thinking that I would like to write a book about Hillel, and this encounter only heightened my resolve. Hillel, I am convinced, would have found absolutely wrongheaded my friend&#x2019;s all-too-common and reflexively discouraging approach to conversion. In the same way, I find it hard to imagine Hillel approving of the strange limbo in which some three hundred thousand Russians of questionable Jewish&#x2014;and sometimes non-Jewish&#x2014;parentage are presently living in Israel, many of whom want to become Jews. I thought of Hillel because he is not only, arguably, Judaism&#x2019;s greatest rabbinic sage, but also its most fearlessly inclusive. <br>&nbsp;<br>He is also the rabbinic figure most willing to give ethical behavior equal&#x2014;or even greater&#x2014;weight, along with strict adherence to the ritual laws. The story for which Hillel is best known, a story we will look at in greater detail in this book, involves a non-Jew who is open to converting to Judaism but who wishes to learn about Judaism not in six weeks, but while &#x201c;standing on one foot&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, in a single sound bite. Having literally been driven away with a stick by another rabbi who is affronted by his request, the non-Jew comes to Hillel, who is open to converting him. Hillel offers the man a single precept that surprisingly mentions neither God nor the rituals of the Torah, only the decent treatment of one&#x2019;s fellow man, along with the admonition to keep studying. If there is an essence of Hillel, it is in this story, in which he himself dares to offer an essence of Judaism. <br>&nbsp;<br>Writing a conventional biography of Hillel is, alas, impossible. All that we know of Hillel&#x2019;s life comes from a variety of stories in the Talmud (and in related works, such as the Midrash). The Talmud is, along with the Bible, Judaism&#x2019;s most important literary creation, a compendium of legal discussions, interpretations of the Bible, and an attempt to decipher what it is that God wants of human beings. Add to this folklore, ethical maxims, and stories, many of them about the Talmud&#x2019;s greatest rabbis. The Talmud was edited around the year 500 c.e., but its roots reach down to the oldest stratum of Judaism and, in the belief of the Talmud&#x2019;s sages, many of its teachings go back to Mount Sinai itself. But though a formal biography is impossible, for reasons that will soon become apparent, I believe it is still possible to construct a very clear impression of a man whose message speaks more urgently to Jews and Judaism today than that of any other Jewish figure in the last two thousand years. <br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, however, when it comes to details, we have considerably more biographical information about some of Judaism&#x2019;s far more ancient figures. In the case of Moses, the preeminent figure of the Hebrew Bible, we know how he met his wife, the names of his sons, his father, mother, brother, and sister, even the story of a certain measure of ill will that Miriam and Aaron, his siblings, felt toward him at one point in the desert wanderings. <br>&nbsp;<br>The character who figures most prominently in the early books of the biblical prophets is Israel&#x2019;s second king, David. The son of Jesse, he is the youngest of eight brothers. We know the story of his first love, Michal; indeed, she is the only woman in the Bible whose love for a man is recorded (&#x201c;Now Michal daughter of Saul had fallen in love with David&#x201d;). We even know the story of the fight that led to the end of whatever love remained in their sad marriage (2 Sam. 6:16&#x2013;23). <br>&nbsp;<br>We move forward now to Hillel, perhaps the greatest rabbi of the Talmud. Hillel lived some twelve hundred years after Moses and about nine hundred years after David, and we should possess considerably more biographical informaï¿½tion about him and his background than about theirs. But we don&#x2019;t. A Talmudic passage refers to him as &#x201c;Hillel the Babylonian,&#x201d; from which we deduce that he was born in Babylon and subsequently came to Israel. The Talmud informs us that he went on to serve as nasi, the foremost reliï¿½gious leader of the community. Elsewhere, the Talmud traces his ancestry to King David, a touch of royalty that befits a man whose descendants would hold positions of religious leadership within the Jewish community for more than four hundred years. But we don&#x2019;t know the names of his father or mother or, for that matter, his wife (though the rabbis tell a story that reveals her to have been a highly senï¿½sitive practitioner of charity). We know the name of one son, Shimon&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t know whether he had other children&#x2014;and of his brother, Shebna, who is identified as a merï¿½chant. And because of the leadership roles many of Hillel&#x2019;s descendants assume, we know their names. Among them are four Gamliels, two additional Shimons, three Yehudahs, and the final leader, known as Hillel the Second.1 We also know of the contemporaneous rabbi, Shammai&#x2014;founder of his own school and the man who drove the would-be convert away&#x2014; with whom Hillel and his disciples had numerous legal disï¿½putes. Surprisingly, however, there is only one story in which the two men actually appear together (Shabbat 17a). Neverï¿½theless, they are a famous emblematic pair of adversaries who each uphold principles essential to Jewish tradition.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also know that Hillel was a disciple of two rabbis, Shmaya and Avtalion, who were the religious leaders of their age, and who were both descended from converts to Judaism. We know that Hillel assumed his position of leadership durï¿½ing a period of great instability and ignorance in Jewish life, in all likelihood related to the megalomaniacal kingship of Herod, who persecuted many of the era&#x2019;s religious teachers. While the Talmud ascribes to Hillel a life span of 120 years (as was the case with Moses), it would seem that his years of religious leadership ranged from approximately 30 b.c.e. to 10 c.e., which would mean this book is being published, coincidentally, on what is possibly the two thousandth anniversary of his passing. <br>&nbsp;<br>What we do possess about Hillel are many stories&#x2014;stories scattered throughout the Talmud and Midrash along with many of his legal rulings and those of his disciples (Beit Hillel, the School of Hillel) that are recorded in the Mishnah, the Tosefta, and both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian editions of the Talmud. &nbsp;It is from these stories and rulings that Hillel enters the Jewish mind as so great a rabbinic sage, a man beloved for his legal daring, passion for learning, remarkable openness to converts, and imaginative acts of kindness. <br>&nbsp;<br>It is both in stories and in legal discussions that we encounter Hillel&#x2019;s willingness to define&#x2014;in one extended sentence, no less&#x2014;Judaism&#x2019;s essence, his openness to determining Jewish law not only on the basis of tradition but also on the basis of his keen understanding of the Torah&#x2019;s intention and his loving confidence in the instincts of the common man.<br>&nbsp;<br>But as familiar as Hillel&#x2019;s teachings are in the Jewish world (and were repeatedly affirmed&#x2014;by a heavenly voice, no less&#x2014;as valid and fundamental), many of his most important ideas have been ignored, sometimes profoundly so. Who was this man whose teachings can feel as radical today as they must have been in his own time, and yet who sits, or ought to sit, squarely at the center of normative Judaism? And how have we moved so far from his vision? Understanding why this has happened&#x2014;and why Hillel&#x2019;s vision must be reclaimed today&#x2014;is what motivated me to write this book. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Chapter 3 </i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;While Standing on One Foot&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Hillel&#x2019;s willingness to run the risk of freezing to death is the story with which he enters Jewish consciousness. The story in which he defines Judaism&#x2019;s essence to a non-Jewish questioner is the story that has kept him there ever since. It is the Talmud&#x2019;s most famous story and one also known&#x2014;unlike almost any other story in the Talmud&#x2014;to many Christians: <br>&nbsp;<br>There was [an] incident involving a Gentile who came before Shammai and said to him: &#x201c;Convert me to Judaism on condition that you will teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one foot.&#x201d; Shammai pushed the man away with the building rod he was holding. Undeï¿½terred, the man then came before Hillel with the same request. Hillel said to him, &#x201c;That which is hateful unto you, do not do unto your neighbor. This is the whole Torah, all the rest is commentary. Now, go and study.&#x201d; (Shabbat 31a) <br>&nbsp;<br>Well-known as this story is, I find that it is generally related with one detail changed. The change occurs in how people usually begin the story: &#x201c;A non-Jew asked Hillel to define Judaism&#x2019;s essence while he [the non-Jew] was standing on one foot.&#x201d; If that had been the non-Jew&#x2019;s request, Hillel&#x2019;s response would have been less surprising. People who present their religious teachings to outsiders often focus on their religion&#x2019;s more humanistic and universalistic elements. But what the non-Jew asked of Hillel was more in the nature of a legal request, one requiring a legal response. He asked to be converted to Judaism on condition that Hillel define for him Judaism&#x2019;s essence. In that context, what is striking is that Hillel does not speak to the man about belief in God or about the importance of observing the Sabbath and Jewish holidays, even though belief in God is Judaism&#x2019;s core belief and the observance of Judaism&#x2019;s ritual laws was one of Hillel&#x2019;s central concerns. He was, of course, a fully observant Jew. Nonetheless, when asked what is most basic for a non-Jew to know before he can convert, Hillel restricts himself to a description of Judaism&#x2019;s ethical essence and then adds, &#x201c;This is the whole Torah! All the rest is commentary! Now, go and study.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that Hillel is willing to offer so brief an explanation&#x2014;fifteen words in the popularly spoken Aramaic&#x2014;indicates that there is a central focus to his understanding of Judaism, one that provides him with a standard that later enables him to modify certain Torah laws in a manner that will shock other rabbis. Only if one understands Judaism as having an ethical essence can one conclude, as Hillel did on several occasions, that sometimes practicing the Torah literally can lead one to violate the Torah&#x2019;s ethical will (for examples of this, see chapter 5). <br>&nbsp;<br>Regarding the unusual question posed by the non-Jew, Talmud scholar Edward Gershfield speculates that the request was characteristic of the Hellenistic intellectual. Many of the philosophical schools of the time strove to give clear and concise statements of their views. For some, especially the Stoics, clarity and simplicity were in themselves evidence of truth. Thus, as Hillel perceived, this speaker was speaking out of the context of the Gentile intellectual world. He was implying that if the Torah had something to say, it could be stated simply and clearly, and, if so, he wanted to hear it. If the message of the Torah could be understood only after much long-winded explanation, that in itself would argue against it being valid.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hillel&#x2019;s response is in effect a negative formulation of the Torah&#x2019;s most famous commandment, &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201d; But why did Hillel not simply quote the Torah verse, which, in its evocation of &#x201c;love,&#x201d; certainly has a more upbeat quality to it? Why did he resort to a negative formulation? <br>&nbsp;<br>Here we&#x2019;re in the realm of conjecture. I suspect that Hillel wanted to offer his questioner a principle he could incorporate into his life immediately. &#x201c;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#x201d; if understood literally, makes demands of us that are sometimes unclear and that few of us are ready to satisfy. For example, does this law obligate you to share all your belongings with others? Maybe yes (the verse would seem to suggest that), maybe no (which is what I suspect most of us feel), but to declare this commandment without extensive explanation could easily confuse the listener. Similarly, you could argue that this verse would oblige us to mourn the death of an acquaintance with the same intensity with which we would mourn the death of a member of our immediate family. After all, if we are commanded to love others as we love ourselves, why wouldn&#x2019;t we be commanded to mourn...</p></p><h2>Equipped to Love Idolatry-Free Relationships</h2><p>Presents practical insights into the dynamic of what hinders one&#39;s freedom to love with God&#39;s kind of love - the spirit of idolatry.It also focuses on the Source of one&#39;s ability to love--a relationship with the spirit of God.You&#39;ll learn to distinguish between God&#39;s kind of love and the world&#39;s kind of love.Harmful,hidden motivations which hinder ability to love will come to light , resulting in a greater freedom to love.You&#39;ll also be equipped to recognize the characteristics and destructiveness of the spirit of idolatry, as well as the nature and healing which comes from the Spirit of God as He loves through you.

Bortwick</b> lives with her family on the Maine coast, where many of her mysteries are set.</p><b>Chapter One</b>&nbsp;Linda LaCroix thought that twelve years in the service of Bowmouth College's English Department should count for something. She had done her stint as a general clerk and had risen to be the department's number one secretary. So why was she being treated by the department's new chair, Professor Danton McGraw, as if she were fresh out of some second-rate two-year business school? All those little lectures on office management and academic protocol. Didn't the guy know she was a grad from Bowmouth's own School of Business--with honors yet? Didn't he see her bachelor's degree diploma framed right there on the secretaries' wall, where he couldn't miss it when he headed into his office? And this semester she and Arlene Burr, the department's chief clerk and assistant secretary, had to sign In-and-Out slips whenever they took off on a two-minute trip for coffee or to run something off the copy machine. Hit the cafeteria for lunch. Stop in the halls for two minutes to say hello to some other human.&nbsp;Now as the late October chills were turning the remaining leaves brown, Linda and Arlene each looked back on her past workstation as something like lost Eden. It had happened with the speed of a falling ax. Last spring and all the years before, the secretary and the clerk had had two adjoining but separate offices, both of which were placed at a safe distance across the corridor from the chairman's office. But then along came Dr. Danton McGraw, who had caused walls to be moved and partitions eliminated. The end result was that now Linda and Arlene found themselves yoked together like conjoined twins fixed in side-by-side desks in the newly created secretaries' space outside Dr. McGraw's office. Here neither could get two paces away from her chair without arousing suspicion from the sharp-eared department chairman. Worse still, neither woman could get away from the other and hunker down in the privacy of her own office space. Take shoes off, sneak a candy bar without sharing it, send a private e-mail to a friend, make a personal phone call. The result was that two good friends and coworkers were beginning to feel an unpleasant tension in their everyday work life.&nbsp;"Trapped," said Arlene to Linda on the Monday of Halloween week. "That's what we are. Say I want to step out of this cage to maybe get a breath of air or go pee. I've practically got to leave fingerprints and bring back a urine sample."&nbsp;But Linda was otherwise focused. She looked around, sniffed the air, and wrinkled her nose. "I don't know about you," she said, "but this place is really starting to stink, and it's not just grungy students coming in and hanging around. Something smells real funny, like there's a fungus growing somewhere. In a file drawer maybe."&nbsp;Linda was a striking woman with a strong opinion on all things. Tall, thin as a wire coat hanger, with a mane of white-blond hair caught into a crown on her head, she had a sharp little chin and narrow blue eyes. And with her whole face bravely covered in a heavy duty makeup and eye enhancements, Linda could have passed for anywhere from thirty-seven to forty-seven. Actually, she was closing in on fifty, a fact she kept quiet about. Her choice for clothing ran to clinging shirts and sweaters--all about a size 3--that still allowed her breasts full presentation rights together with constricted breathing. Then there was the snug skirt, the high-fashion boots and long purple fingernails. Altogether, Linda, known to some of the faculty clowns as "Linda Lovely," was a female who resembled one of those handsome slender but lethal insects that stand on two legs and eat family members. Most of the English Department regulars, faculty and adjuncts, did well to stay on the right side of Linda.&nbsp;The yin to Linda's yang, Arlene was a perfect contrast. She was a comfortably built woman with a cheerful round face, an almost comically turned-up nose, and dark brown hair pulled back with two clips. While Linda dealt with the public with the verbal equivalent of a scalpel, Arlene soothed, comforted, and counseled patience. However, until the beginning of the new semester, Arlene had pretty much taken the faculty ego clashes, the complaints of unhappy English majors, the pleas of adjuncts and teaching fellows as they came. But with the arrival of Dr. McGraw and the new secretary-clerk double-desk setup, her nervous system seemed to have developed a greater sensitivity and her natural buoyancy showed signs of leakage.&nbsp;Now Arlene herself took a long sniff. Well, Linda was certainly right about the smell.&nbsp;"I mean," went on Linda, "maybe it's the new carpet they laid before we moved over here, but I wouldn't put it past someone to poison us. A little bit. And even if no one is doing that, some new carpet dyes have fumes that make you really sick. But this smell seems to be coming right from under your desk."&nbsp;Arlene grimaced. "I don't think it's the carpet. But you know, I'll bet it's that mouse. I'd forgotten the mouse."&nbsp;"Mouse?" said Linda, lifting her feet up and peering at the floor.&nbsp;"Found him two days ago with that batch of blue exam books left over from the spring semester," said Arlene. "On top of those shelves." She waved at a line of shelves packed with catalogues, directories, student handbooks, and reams of printer paper. "I felt kinda bad. You know, like he reminded me of Stuart Little. But all dried up and skinny. He must have starved to death."&nbsp;"What," demanded Linda, "did you do with this mouse?"&nbsp;Arlene grinned. "I wanted to slip him into McGraw's desk drawer but lost my nerve. I need this job. Besides, the mouse might have carried that virus, what's its name?"&nbsp;"Hanta virus. Spread by rodents," said Linda. "So where is the mouse now?"&nbsp;Arlene shrugged. "I think someone distracted me just after I'd found him, so he may be right there in one of the wastebaskets. Like my wastebasket."&nbsp;"Oh, ugh," said Linda.&nbsp;"Ugh," agreed Arlene.&nbsp;"Okay, okay," said Linda. "I'll call Maintenance and they can set some traps or whatever they do about mice. And, for once," she added firmly, "I agree with McGraw. With everything else going on, we don't need mice." She nodded in the direction of a door with a window and the legend Chairman (gold on a black plaque) fixed below the glass.&nbsp;"Please, no traps," said Arlene, apparently still affected by the idea of Stuart Little. "I mean not real ones. I have a little Havahart trap thing for mice. I can bring it in. And it's no wonder this one starved. Before McGraw turned up there used to be plenty of snacks for mice. I used to keep pretzels in my drawer, and the students were always leaving foodstuff around, and of course we were allowed to have our lunch in here. I even had that one mouse, you remember, the one I called Rosie. Last winter."&nbsp;"I don't remember Rosie," said Linda. "We each had our own office space then, remember. But, whatever you do, don't encourage mice. McGraw is absolutely right about bringing in food. If mice really start moving in, he'll probably start having a major housekeeping inspection. He'll be going around with white gloves and a microscope. Like the army."&nbsp;"He was in the navy," Arlene reminded her.&nbsp;"Whichever," said Linda. "But listen to this. Yesterday he just found out that old Professor Morgan keeps a hot plate in his office closet--you know how far away that guy's office is, way down by the back stairs, so he must have missed it. Well, there was Morgan with a teakettle going and he'd had Chinese brought in. All those little white cardboard boxes. Talk about a fire hazard. And mouse heaven. That office is ripe, really ripe."&nbsp;"The poor old guy," said Arlene. "He's been here since World War Two. Or Korea. You can't change him; you can't inspect his office. You can't even get in the place without a shovel. And he's emeritus. Me, I think he's kind of a cute old geezer. And he's pretty smart. But he'll probably be given the boot by the end of this semester."&nbsp;"Wrong. Professor Morgan was asked back again because we lost that new nineteenth-century guy last spring to NYU. Anyway, he's been given those grad seminars on Wordsworth and Keats and Byron, and he's scheduled to go through the spring semester. I've had to print up a whole new guide and syllabus for his students."&nbsp;"Forget about mice. McGraw has Vera Pruczak on his mind," Arlene pointed out.&nbsp;"And who's to blame him there?" said Linda. "I mean, talk about a disaster. That Todd Mancuso assaulted right on the stage. In the middle of a scene. His ear practically cut off, plus almost having a fractured skull."&nbsp;"Yeah," said Arlene. "It was that Terri Colman and Kay Biddle who did the job. I heard from a friend who saw the rehearsal that there was blood spattered everywhere. But you know theatre people. They do things like that."&nbsp;"For the record," said Linda, "A lot of these gals change their names. Some have lousy ones and want something jazzy that looks good up in lights. That Louisa Scotini made me cross out her first name and use 'Weeza.' I end up making corrections whenever I send in the grades to the dean's office. As for that Todd Mancuso, honestly."&nbsp;"What I've heard," said Arlene, "is that Todd Mancuso is too much of a smart-ass for his own good. Thinks females are just drooling for his attentions."&nbsp;"So good for Terri and Kay, beating him up like that," said Arlene. "And you know they're both pets of Vera's.

The revealing and inspiring pieces here span a lifetime of enthusiasm for discovering what makes the world tick - including uproarious tales of early student experiments; safecracking and outwitting US censors during the Second World War; his first lecture as a graduate student (to an audience including Albert Einstein); and the memories of the father who delighted in showing him the world and sparked his insatiable curiosity.</p><p>Why do we do science? Beyond altruistic and self-aggrandizing motivations, many of our best scientists work long hours seeking the electric thrill that comes only from learning something that nobody knew before. <i>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</i>, a collection of previously unpublished or difficult-to-find short works by maverick physicist Richard Feynman, takes its title from his own answer. From TV interview transcripts to his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, we see his quick, sharp wit, his devotion to his work, and his unwillingness to bow to social pressure or convention. It's no wonder he was only grudgingly admired by the establishment during his lifetime--read his "Minority Report to the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> Inquiry" to see him blowing off political considerations as impediments to finding the truth.<p> Feynman had a fantastic sense of humor, and his memoirs of his Manhattan Project days roil with fun despite his later misgivings about nuclear weapons. Though one or two pieces are a bit hard to follow for the nontechnical reader, for the most part the book is easygoing and engaging on a personal rather than a scientific level. Freeman Dyson's foreword and editor Jeffrey Robbins's introductions to each essay set the stage well and are respectful without being worshipful. Though Feynman has been gone now for many years, his work lives on in quantum physics, computer design, and nanotechnology; like any great scientist, he asked more questions than he answered, to give future generations the pleasure of finding things out. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>George Bellows: American Artist (Writers on Art)</h2><p>A study of George Bellows&#39; brief but prolific career considers the influences of his early life, examines his more intimate work in portraiture, and offers a perspective on his last work, &#34;The Picket Fence&#34;</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University.Born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1882, George Bellows journeyed east in 1904, against his conservative father's wishes, and reinvented American art with his poetic realist canvases of New York City's teeming street life. Novelist/essayist Oates articulates what was radical in Bellows's approach: the formally sophisticated presentation of the dynamic, the vulgar, the authentic, the brutal. She finds his "perversely ecstatic" vision of urban tumult Whitmanesque in its embracing of disorder and its unswervingly optimistic mysticism. Yet Bellows, who died of a ruptured appendix at the age of 42, also did throbbing, visceral seascapes, allegories and urban dreamscapes that call to mind Albert Pinkham Ryder. These works, in Oates's estimation, reveal Bellows as a visionary, a poet of violent emotions, akin to van Gogh, Gauguin and Emil Nolde. Oates's assured, uncannily insightful essay brings us closer to Bellows's spiritual center than most scholarly studies of him.

Scott Fitzgerald, the iconic American writer of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> who is more widely read today than ever.</b><br><br><i>I&#x2019;d Die For You</i> is a collection of the last remaining unpublished and uncollected short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald, edited by Anne Margaret Daniel. Fitzgerald did not design the stories in <i>I&#x2019;d Die For You</i> as a collection. Most were submitted individually to major magazines during the 1930s and accepted for publication during Fitzgerald&#x2019;s lifetime, but were never printed. Some were written as movie scenarios and sent to studios or producers, but not filmed. Others are stories that could not be sold because their subject matter or style departed from what editors expected of Fitzgerald. They date from the earliest days of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s career to the last. They come from various sources, from libraries to private collections, including those of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s family.<br> <br>Readers will experience Fitzgerald writing about controversial topics, depicting young men and women who actually spoke and thought more as young men and women did, without censorship. Rather than permit changes and sanitizing by his contemporary editors, Fitzgerald preferred to let his work remain unpublished, even at a time when he was in great need of money and review attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d Die For You,&#x201d; the collection&#x2019;s title story, is drawn from Fitzgerald&#x2019;s stays in the mountains of North Carolina when his health, and that of his wife Zelda, was falling apart. With the addition of a Hollywood star and film crew to the Smoky Mountain lakes and pines, Fitzgerald brings in the cinematic world in which he would soon be living. Most of the stories printed here come from this time period, during the middle and late1930s, though the collection spans Fitzgerald&#x2019;s career from 1920 to the end of his life.<br> <br>The book is subtitled <i>And Other Lost Stories</i> in recognition of an absence until now. Some of the eighteen stories were physically lost, coming to light only in the past few years. All were lost, in one sense or another: lost in the painful shuffle of the difficulties of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s life in the middle 1930s; lost to readers because contemporary editors did not understand or accept what he was trying to write; lost because archives are like that, and good things can wait patiently in libraries for many centuries sometimes. <i>I&#x2019;d Die For You And Other Lost Stories</i> echoes as well the nostalgia and elegy in Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s famous phrase &#x201c;a lost generation,&#x201d; that generation for whom Fitzgerald was a leading figure.<br> <br>Written in his characteristically beautiful, sharp, and surprising language, exploring themes both familiar and fresh, these stories provide new insight into the bold and uncompromising arc of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s career. <i>I&#x2019;d Die For You </i>is a revealing, intimate look at Fitzgerald&#x2019;s creative process that shows him to be a writer working at the fore of modern literature&#x2014;in all its developing complexities.</p><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four while working on <i>The Last Tycoon</i>.

I was tagged with that by my first writings up to 1925. Since then I have written stories about young love. They have been done with increasing difficulty and increasing insincerity. I would either be a miracle man or a hack if I could go on turning out an identical product for three decades.<br> <br>I know that is what&#x2019;s expected of me, but in that direction the well is pretty dry and I think I am much wiser in not trying to strain for it but rather to open up a new well, a new vein. . . . Nevertheless, an overwhelming number of editors continue to associate me with an absorbing interest in young girls&#x2014;an interest that at my age would probably land me behind bars.<br> <br>&#x2014;F. Scott Fitzgerald to Kenneth Littauer, editor of Collier&#x2019;s magazine, 1939<br> <br>After his sensational start as a professional writer in 1919, F. Scott Fitzgerald was increasingly stereotyped as a writer of what he himself had dubbed &#x201c;the Jazz Age.&#x201d; Readers, and editors, anticipated from him standard romances, poor boys wooing rich girls, parties and glamour and glib flappers. When he tried something different, in a darker and deeper historical decade, and as a mature man who had lived through much pain, Fitzgerald found it very difficult to break out of this early stereotype. The young writer surrounded by campus life at Princeton (This Side of Paradise) becoming part of a new, golden couple (The Beautiful and Damned) and then the creator and chronicler of the Jazz Age (the story collections of the 1920s, and The Great Gatsby) gives way straight to The Crack-Up in most literary biographies and readers&#x2019; conceptions of Fitzgerald. He wanted, as he put it, to &#x201c;open up a new well, a new vein.&#x201d; Unfortunately, only a very few appreciated what he was trying to do.<br> <br>These stories are about divorce and despair; working days and lonesome nights; smart teenagers unable to attend college or find a job during the Great Depression; American history, with its wars, its horrors, and its promises; sex, with marriage thereafter&#x2014;or not; and the wild, bright vitality and grinding poverty of New York City, a place Fitzgerald truly loved and understood in all its possibilities, shallowness, and ugliness. They show him not as a &#x201c;sad young man&#x201d; growing old, and trapped in the golden days of his own recent past, but at the fore of Modern literature, in all its experimentalism and developing complexities.<br> <br>***<br> <br>F. Scott Fitzgerald, graying and chunking up, is reputedly one of the most difficult authors from whom editors may wangle stories these days. He is the literary symbol of an era&#x2014;the era of the new generation&#x2014;and editors continue to want stories of flask gin and courteous collegiates preceding ladies through windshields on midnight joy rides. The public has acquired this Fitzgerald taste, too. But Fitzgerald has taken an elderly and naturally serious turn. Mellowed is the term. He wants to write mellowly, too. And if they won&#x2019;t let him he won&#x2019;t write at all. So there.<br> <br>&#x2014;O. O. McIntyre, &#x201c;New York Day by Day&#x201d; column, 1936<br> <br>Contemporary editors of popular, mass-market magazines at the time were not philistines, of course. However, there were good reasons for them to shy away from what Fitzgerald was writing by the mid-1930s; some of the stories are dark and stark. Only one editor fully saw the merits of what Fitzgerald was trying to do and published him consistently&#x2014;Arnold Gingrich, of Esquire, a novelist himself. Fitzgerald sold the brilliant Pat Hobby stories to Esquire for $200 or $250 apiece in the two years before his death. (This was a low price to Fitzgerald, but not for a writer during the Depression; and not if you consider its relative worth, when according to the 1940 U.S. Census the average annual income was just over $1,000.) Gingrich encouraged Fitzgerald to turn his fine chronicles of a failed, drunken, Irish-American screenwriter into a novel. But even Gingrich wouldn&#x2019;t go for some stories; Fitzgerald wrote about young men worrying over venereal disease and having gotten sixteen-year-olds pregnant, and Esquire said no thanks.<br> <br>Most of these stories are from the days when America, and the world, was in the Great Depression. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fortunes, so high just a few years before, had fallen with the country&#x2019;s. He was often sick, often broke, and anxiously shuttling between the Baltimore area&#x2014;where he and Zelda had settled with their daughter, Scottie&#x2014;and a string of health resorts in the North Carolina mountains. After a breakdown in Europe in 1930, Zelda was hospitalized in February 1932 at the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. For the rest of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s life, and hers, Zelda would be in and out of costly private clinics and hospitals; the pressure Scott put on himself to earn enough money to pay for these was immense. From early 1935, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s own health was a concern to him, too, and despite his fear of a recurrence of the tuberculosis with which he&#x2019;d been diagnosed as a young man, he complicated matters by smoking and drinking to excess.<br> <br>However, the first story in this collection, &#x201c;The I.O.U.,&#x201d; comes from Fitzgerald&#x2019;s earliest days as a writer; and the last complete ones, &#x201c;The Women in the House&#x201d; and &#x201c;Salute to Lucy and Elsie,&#x201d; from a stint in Hollywood in 1939 when he had quit drinking and was eagerly working on a new novel, published after his death as The Last Tycoon. There is writing from every stage of his well-chronicled career&#x2014;the youth reveling in bright days and nights of success and celebrity; the husband and father at thirty suddenly plunged into a world of doctors and hospitals because of his wife&#x2019;s illness; a struggling man in poor health himself, looking for that new vein to open up for his own writing; and, above all, a professional writer who never failed to take inspiration and energy from the American landscape and personalities around him. That hunger never ended for F. Scott Fitzgerald, and these stories show it.<br> <br>***<br> <br>Is there any money in collections of short stories?<br> <br>&#x2014;Fitzgerald to his agent, Harold Ober, 1920<br> <br>Short stories were, from the first, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s bread and butter. When Princeton&#x2019;s president, John Grier Hibben, wrote him to complain of, among other things, the characterization of a shallow university and its students in his story &#x201c;The Four Fists&#x201d; (1920), Fitzgerald replied, &#x201c;I wrote it in desperation one evening because I had a three inch pile of rejection slips and it was financially necessary for me to give the magazines what they wanted.&#x201d;<br> <br>To give the magazines what they wanted: that was Fitzgerald&#x2019;s brief as a young writer, and he continued in this very lucrative mode through the 1920s. He sold his work for money and was acutely aware of that fact and of how much he could make, quickly, with short stories, as opposed to waiting until he had enough of a novel complete to consider serialization. He and his family lived well, but after the immense success of his first two novels, The Great Gatsby (1925) did not sell well, and he needed money. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s discouragement over Gatsby&#x2019;s lukewarm reception helped to keep him writing short stories for the Saturday Evening Post and spurred him to turn to work on screenplays in Hollywood as the Jazz Age ended. Fitzgerald was walking the tightrope between art and commerce, and did it as well as any writer of his generation.<br> <br>He was also quite aware of what was his best writing and what was, as he termed it, hack work. Fitzgerald never lied to himself, or anyone else, about the difference between his commercially successful and his imaginatively satisfying stories. He was delighted when the two categories coincided, when stories he valued, like &#x201c;Babylon Revisited,&#x201d; &#x201c;Winter Dreams,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Rich Boy,&#x201d; and the stories about Basil Duke Lee, sold for a high price. He always wished the ones he himself thought best would sell better. &#x201c;I am rather discouraged that a cheap story like The Popular Girl written in one week while the baby was being born brings $1500. + a genuinely imaginative thing into which I put three weeks real entheusiasm [sic] like The Diamond in the Sky [&#x201c;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&#x201d;] brings not a thing,&#x201d; he wrote to his agent, Harold Ober, in 1922. &#x201c;But, by God + Lorimer, I&#x2019;m going to make a fortune yet.&#x201d; George Horace Lorimer, the Yale graduate who edited the Saturday Evening Post from 1899 to 1936, paid Fitzgerald well for his writing: a fortune, in fact, for a young writer. In 1929 the Post began to pay him $4,000 per story, the equivalent of over $55,000 today. Yet Fitzgerald chafed under the golden chains, telling H. L. Mencken in 1925, just after Gatsby was published:<br> <br>My trash for the Post grows worse and worse as there is less and less heart in it&#x2014;strange to say my whole heart was in my first trash. I thought that the Offshore Pirate was quite as good as Benediction. I never really &#x201c;wrote down&#x201d; until after the failure of the Vegetable and that was to make this book [Gatsby] possible. I would have written down long ago if it had been profitable&#x2014;I tried it unsuccessfully for the movies. People don&#x2019;t seem to realize that for an intelligent man writing down is about the hardest thing in the world.<br> <br>To his editor Maxwell Perkins at Scribner, in the same year, he was blunter and briefer: &#x201c;The more I get for my trash the less I can bring myself to write.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fitzgerald always considered himself a novelist, though he was a superb writer of short fiction&#x2014;not a more humble form of writing than the novel, just briefer. His short stories, loved and well-known, stand alone, but they were often a testing ground for him, a place for rough drafts, an initial space for ideas and descriptions, characters and places, elements of which would find their way into his next novel. The ledger of his life and writings, which Fitzgerald kept until 1938, lists many stories in the &#x201c;Record of Published Fiction&#x201d; section as &#x201c;stripped and permanently buried.&#x201d; That &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; process is readily visible in his tear sheets and on magazine copies of the stories he published, where Fitzgerald revised, redacted, and indicated passages that later appeared in The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, and Tender Is the Night.<br> <br>The stories in this collection, most of which are from the middle and late 1930s, feature lines that will be familiar to those who have read Fitzgerald&#x2019;s working papers (published as The Notebooks of F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1978) and The Love of the Last Tycoon, his final novel, left unfinished at his death.<br> <br>***<br> <br>Is there money in writing movies? Do you sell scenarios?<br> <br>&#x2014;Fitzgerald to Harold Ober, December 1919<br> <br>The pull and possibilities of Hollywood, and of writing scenarios and screenplays for movies, were a lure for Fitzgerald from his earliest writing days. In September 1915, when he was a sophomore at Princeton, the Daily Princetonian ran an advertisement that read: &#x201c;Special Notice to Students Who Fail / Motion Picture Studio Work opens an almost immediate field for substantial earnings to young men who possess some natural ability.&#x201d; This equation of motion picture work and failing was writ large for Fitzgerald from his first time in Hollywood. Though several of his stories and two of his novels were made into movies in the 1920s, he did not like them&#x2014;he and Zelda thought the 1926 film version of The Great Gatsby, now lost, was &#x201c;rotten.&#x201d; Nonetheless, in January 1927 the Fitzgeralds settled at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles for three months while Scott worked on a screenplay, made to order, for Constance Talmadge. Talmadge, nicknamed &#x201c;Brooklyn Connie,&#x201d; was a major silent star trying to break into talkie comedies. At first, he and Zelda enjoyed meeting and socializing with movie stars, but it soon wore thin. The screenplay was rejected, and the Fitzgeralds headed home to the East. Zelda reported that Scott &#x201c;says he will never write another picture because it is too hard, but I do not think writers mean what they say[.]&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right. Those unremarkable sales and mixed reviews for The Great Gatsby changed Fitzgerald as a writer. He threatened a future course of action almost immediately, writing to Perkins from Europe in the spring of 1925:<br> <br>In all events I have a book of good stories for the fall. Now I shall write some cheap ones until I&#x2019;ve accumulated enough for my next novel. When that is finished and published I&#x2019;ll wait and see. It if will support me with no more intervals of trash I&#x2019;ll go on as a novelist. If not I&#x2019;m going to quit, come home, go to Hollywood and learn the movie business.<br> <br>In 1931, Fitzgerald went back to Hollywood, again for the money, for another miserable few months that proved creatively fruitless and personally taxing. Tender Is the Night, the novel he had been working on, remained unfinished. And this time, Zelda was not with Scott in Los Angeles; she was at her parents&#x2019; home in Montgomery, Alabama, on the verge of a breakdown that would send her into a hospital the following spring. However, her judgment, in writing to her husband in Hollywood in November 1931, could not be sounder: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry your work isn&#x2019;t interesting. I had hoped it might present new dramatic facets that would make up for the tediousness of it. If it seems too much drudgery and you are faced with &#x2018;get to-gether and talk-it-over&#x2019; technique&#x2014;come home, Sweet. You will at least have eliminated Hollywood forever. I wouldn&#x2019;t stay and waste time on what seems an inevitable mediocrity and too hard going.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though he failed&#x2014;again&#x2014;in Hollywood in 1931, Fitzgerald, needing money&#x2014;again&#x2014;returned there for good in the summer of 1937. The third time was not the charm. In the title story of this collection, we see his view of the movie business&#x2014;the inherent corrosiveness and the danger to individual creativity. Arnold Gingrich had warned Fitzgerald, in 1934, not to go back, and told him why in no uncertain terms: &#x201c;It would be awful to see you piss away your talent in Hollywood again and I hope it won&#x2019;t come to that. Because, regarding the written word like a musical instrument, you are the supreme virtuoso&#x2014;nobody can draw a purer finer tone from the string of an English sentence&#x2014;and what the hell has the written word to do with Hollywood?&#x201d;<br> <br>As Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins shortly before he left for the West Coast, with cold self-knowledge and prescience, &#x201c;Each time I have gone to Hollywood, in spite of the enormous salary, has really set me back financially and artistically. . . . I certainly have this one more novel [The Love of the Last Tycoon], but it may have to remain among the unwritten books of this world.&#x201d; Fitzgerald&#x2019;s bills were large, for everything from his own living expenses to Zelda&#x2019;s private sanitarium near Asheville, North Carolina, to Scottie&#x2019;s schools. And the contract from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was large, too&#x2014;$1,000 a week for his work as a script doctor. The last few of his stories were written in the time he could borrow from work on the screenplays of others&#x2014;screenplays it was mind-numbing to read, and on which his dismissive comments survive in the margins. The Hollywood work discouraged and literally sickened him, and his lack of enthusiasm for the place is evident in the weakness of his screenplay scenarios. Yet that MGM contract saved Fitzgerald when he was deeply in debt, and he found the material for The Love of the Last Tycoon there. He was happy when he died, working hard on that &#x201c;one more novel,&#x201d; but the ps...</p><h2>Basic Economics Fourth Edition A Natural Law Approach to Economics</h2><p>Economics textbook designed for Christian schools/homeschools.

Perhaps it is only natural that an artist whose painting incarnates the Cagean premise that there is nothing to communicate should be moved to address that fact over and over. For this reason, the first edition of Richter's writings, <i>The Daily Practice of Painting</i> (published in 1993 by MIT Press) was an especially compelling collection, gathering the speculations of an artist profoundly involved in states of doubt, uncertainty and negation. Edited by Hans Ulrich Obrist, it quickly became a basic text in all of the creative fields. For this new, complete edition of the writings, Richter has placed his private archive at the editor's disposal; most of the photographic material comes from this archive and has not been previously published. The volume begins with the artist's farewell letters to his teacher Heinz Lohmar in 1961, is augmented with 15 unpublished texts from 1962 to 1993, as well as texts from the past 14 (highly productive) years of his career, and closes with an interview on his contribution to the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007. In between are public statements on specific exhibitions, private reflections drawn from personal correspondence, answers to questions posed by critics and journal excerpts discussing the intentions, methods and subjects of his works from various periods. At more than 600 pages (the first edition was only 288), it is without doubt the essential companion to Richter's colossal oeuvre.<br><b>Gerhard Richter</b> was born in Dresden in 1932.

A lot has been written about trust: about what it is and what it can do for people, families, companies, communities and countries. Often, good work is being sabotaged by interpersonal conflict, political infighting, paralysis, stagnation, apathy, or cynicism. Almost always, one can trace these problems to a breakdown in trust. It not only kills good work, it also inevitably creates some degree of misery, annoyance, fear, anger, frustration, resentment, and resignation. By contrast, in successful companies where people are innovative, engage in productive conflict and debate about ideas, and have fun working together, one can find strong trusting relationships. Having the trust of those you work with is too important not to be intentional about building and maintaining it. With this book, you will learn how to build and maintain strong trusting relationships with others, and repair trust when it is broken, by being intentional and consistent in your language and actions. Understanding and consistently demonstrating trustworthy language and behavior will help you earn and keep the trust of the people you work with.</p><p>Charles Feltman is an executive coach, consultant and facilitator. he coaches executives and managers in developing the thinking, being and doing that constitute the most effective leadership in their organizations.

The Thin Book ofï¿½ Trust teaches those traits that will help you earn and keep the trust of those with whom you work. The results will affect the trajectory of your company and your life." --Stephen M.R. Covey, author of the New York Times bestseller The SPEED of Trust<br><br>"Everyone talks about trust but few understand what it really means, how it is built or destroyed. Charles Feltman's The Thin Book ofï¿½ Trust is an excellent guide to understanding the distinctions of trust; sincerity, reliability, competence and care. This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in building trust-based relationships with their clients, colleagues and employees." --Elaine Howard, Chief Talent Officer, Millward Brown<br><br>"The is an excellent book on an important subject. It provides a clear explanation of a new way of looking at trust and real, practical ways to build, maintain and rebuild trust. The vignettes provide vivid pictures of how assessments of sincerity, reliability, competence and caring play out in the workplace. The sample conversations about trust are excellent templates.

It also sheds new light on how many Irish Americans understood Catholicism."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"This is a rich and subtly crafted interpretation of the Molly Maguires and their world, and the reader benefits from the prodigious research Kenny carried out...Kenny's definitive study presents a nuanced vision of the Molly Maguires' lives and the world they lived in; and his book sheds a remarkable light more generally on labour struggles in the mid-19th century."--<em>Labor History</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny's <em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em> is easily the best book ever written about the subject. It is meticulously researched, carefully argued, and well written, and it brings all of the events to life...His book is a story of the hardships of the mines, of the power of the owners and their paid police forces, and most especially of the power of the media to portray the events in such a way as to inflame persons around the nation. And this book is about the way we write history...The controversy over the Molly Maguires will not end with Kenny's book. Some will see them as brutal terrorists and others as martyred heroes of the labor movement. But no one will ever again be able to think or write seriously about the 1870s violence in the anthracite coal region [of eastern Pennsylvania] without reading this stunning volume."--Kenneth T. Jackson, Columbia University, in a review for the History Book Club, January 1998<p></p><br>"Until now the Molly Maguires have dwelled in the half-light of myth and propaganda. No longer. In <em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em>, Kevin Kenny dispels the shadows. Kenny gives us the flesh-and-blood men, their passions and grievances, the crimes they committed and the crimes committed against them. This is a first-class work of scholarship that unfolds with the power of a detective novel. Along with making sense of the Molly Maguires, Kenny has produced an outstanding piece of historical enlightenment. He made me think, and he made me weep. I am in awe of his achievement."--Peter Quinn, author of <em>Banished Children of Eve</em><p></p><br>"After thorough research in both Irish and American sources, Kevin Kenny has produced by far the best and the most sensitive treatment of the Molly Maguires, the Irish-born anthracite miners who battled corporate capitalism and its legal and clerical allies in Gilded-Age Pennsylvania. Kenny's book does far more than <em>make sense</em> of this important and tragic episode, for his is a very major contribution to our general understanding of working-class, immigration, and Irish-American history."--Kerby Miller, University of Missouri-Columbia<p></p><br>"<em>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</em> is destined to become a definitive work on the subject and one that this reviewer recommends highly."--Thomas Larkin, <em>An Scathan</em><p></p><br>"Kenny's treatment of the Mollies is thoroughly researched and neatly balanced...Kenny has assimilated and built on a century of scholarship. His excavation beneath the mythical qualities of the Molly Maguires is likely to be the standard work for some time."--<em>Labor Studies Journal</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny's book plunges right into this complex amalgam of events and perceptions to understand both sides of the Mollys...Kenny's monograph is well reasoned and effectively constructed...[T]his study gives the Molly Maguires their proper place in late-nineteenth-century America, not as devils or angels, but as real men engaged in real and often violent struggles for a living and a life."--<em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Intended as a book about the Molly Maguires both as an organization and as a symbol of unionism, Kenny tries first to understand how community was constituted among Irish-American miners. He then seeks to understand how the violent murders committed by a secret organization came to stand as a middle-class symbol of the dangers of unions and Irish workers...Kenny has demonstrated how the exploration of memory can help broaden the scope of labor history."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"[A] remarkably fine work of historical research and analysis."--Thomas Flanagan, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Kenny has certainly done historical justice to his fascinating, if elusive, topic...[O]ne should salute a scholar who takes on a controversial subject and, with sober mastery, rips off the veils of legend."--Michael Kazin, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"A convincing and well-written book, Kenny's work clearly establishes the ways and means used to 'demonize' the Molly Maguires and through them the Irish and trade union movement...He 'makes sense' of the Molly Maguires and, in doing so, the economic, social, and political forces surrounding them...He opens a new and rich perspective on a well-known event."--Robert D. Sampson for <em>H-Labor</em><p></p><br>"This is a thorough examination of the role of the Molly Maguires in the bitter struggle of working people to attain justice in 19th-Century USA and an incisive expose of the ruthless methods employed against all efforts to organize labor...It would be especially useful in a course that studies American resistance movements."--Anthony Garavente, California State University<p></p><br>"[Kenny] has made sense of the Molly Maguires and...all historians of both American labour and Irish rural protest are in his debt. He has written a fine book."--<em>Saothar</em><p></p><br>"[The book] is a fascinating and compelling study which not alone contains a vivid account of the Molly Maguires, but also incorporates a sustained interpretation of the origins, ideology and broader importance of this shadowy grouping."--<em>Immigrants and Minorities</em><p></p><br>"Seldom have I read a book that does a better job than this one of unraveling popular mythology and clearing away the ambiguities surrounding a conplex and contentious topic. That it grew directly out of the author's Ph.D. thesis and will almost certainly be considered the standard work on the question for some time to come makes it all the more impressive."--<em>Journal of American Ethnic History</em><p></p><br>"The definitive word on the Molly Maguires...thoroughly researched and neatly balanced...Kenny has assimilated and built on a century of scholarship. His excavation beneath the mythical qualities of the Molly Maguires is likely to be the standard work for some time."--<em>Errata</em><p></p><br>"[A] well-balanced and well-researched study which substantially increases our understanding of this legendary group."--<em>Pennsylvania History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Heat Wave: Surviving the Fourth Bowl Judgment (Left Behind: The Kids)</h2><p>#37 <i>Heat Wave</i> <br><br>#38 <i>The Perils of Love</i> <br><br>With over 11 million copies sold in the series, Left Behind: The Kids is a favorite of readers ages 10-14.

Each member of a democracy, Addams believed, is under a moral obligation to seek out diverse experiences, making a daily effort to confront others' perspectives. Morality must be seen as a social rather than an individual endeavor, and democracy as a way of life rather than merely a basis for laws. Failing this, both democracy and ethics remain sterile, empty concepts.<br> In this, Addams's earliest book on ethics--presented here with a substantial introduction by Charlene Haddock Seigfried--she reflects on the factors that hinder the ability of all members of society to determine their own well-being. Observing relationships between charitable workers and their clients, between factory owners and their employers, and between household employers and their servants, she identifies sources of friction and shows how conceiving of democracy as a social obligation can lead to new, mutually beneficial lines of conduct. She also considers the proper education of workers, struggles between parents and their adult daughters over conflicting family and social claims, and the merging of politics with the daily lives of constituents.<br> "The sphere of morals is the sphere of action," Addams proclaims.&nbsp; It is not enough to believe passively in the innate dignity of all human beings. Rather, one must work daily to root out racial, gender, class, and other prejudices from personal relationships.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><b>Jane Addams</b> (1860-1935) was a social activist, Progressive reformer, and author of many books of social criticism.

Interested in technology, Michel was able to play in his father&#x2019;s workshop since early childhood, and as a teenager completed an apprenticeship as an industrial mechanic in the motor industry. For a number of years, Michel worked as a bicycle mechanic for handicapped people.

Here are the printers who founded the first papers, arriving in town with a shirttail of type and a secondhand press, setting up shop under trees, in tents, in barns or storefronts, moving on when the town failed, or into larger quarters if it flourished. Using many excerpts from the early papers themselves, Dary shows us the amazing ways the early editors stretched the language, often inventing new words to describe unusual events or to lambaste their targets--and how they sometimes had to defend their right of free speech with fists or guns. We see women working in partnership with their husbands or out on their own, and tramp printers who moved from place to place as need for their services rose and fell.<br>Here, too, are Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Horace Greeley--and William Allen White writing on the death of his young daughter. Here is the Telegraph and Texas Register article that launched the legend of the Alamo, and dozens of tongue-in-cheek, brilliant, or moving reports of national events and local doings, including holdups, train robberies, wars, elections, shouting matches, hyperbolic vegetable-growing contests, weddings, funerals, births, and much, much more.<br>In Red Blood &amp; Black Ink David Dary makes a strong case for the importance of the press in settling the West and helping to knit the nation together, making us into the country we are today. A fascinating look at a neglected part of our history.</p><p>After a reader shot the editor of a Kansas newspaper, the jury refused to convict the culprit. "That's just the way it is with some juries," reported another newspaper. "They think it no more harm to shoot an editor than a Jack-rabbit." Indeed, the men who reported the news on the frontier (including such luminaries as Mark Twain and Bret Harte) had to be a wild bunch. <i>Red Blood and Black Ink</i> provides an informative and very entertaining look at how the frontier press covered the news in the roughest towns around and helped set a cultural tone that resonates to the present day."One of the very best of David Dary's masterfully well-informed and entertaining histories of life in the Old West--exuberant, evocative, and all joy to read."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>--Alvin M.

They cover and protect a bird; signal a bird&#x2019;s sex, age, and breeding status; and enable it to fly. But feathers don&#x2019;t last forever, and they need to be replaced by a process known as molt.&nbsp;Molt can seem like an intimidating topic but really it isn&#x2019;t. Even though birds have evolved many ways of balancing when and where to molt with other aspects of their life history, their molting patterns are actually very orderly and built upon only four underlying strategies: simple basic, complex basic, simple alternate, and complex alternate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Peterson Reference Guide to Molt in North American Birds</i> clearly explains the molting strategies of each family of birds, using beautiful, large photographs to illustrate and simplify this important and useful tool in bird identification.&nbsp;Armed with a new understanding and appreciation for molt, birders can improve their skills with any number of species. Beyond identification, birds&#x2019; molting patterns reflect factors such as their habitat, food, clutch size, migration distance, and body size, and offer a novel window through which to view the remarkable lives of birds.</p><h2>The Rose Rent (Chronicles of Brother Cadfael)</h2><p>In honor of her husband, young, beautiful, and wealthy widow Judith Perle donates a house to the Abbey at Shrewsbury--for the annual rent of one white rose. Judith has no shortage of suitors, and if she remarries, her dowry would be all the greater if the house were returned due to non-payment of rent. So when a priest charged with delivering the rose is found murdered, and the rose bush is found hacked to pieces, Brother Cadfael finds he must root out a killer.</p><p>ELLIS PETERS (1913-1995) was the pen name of English novelist Edith Pargeter, author of scores of books under her own name. She was a recipient of the Silver Dagger Award and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award, conferred by the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain, as well as the coveted Edgar, awarded by the Mystery Writers of America.In this 13th mystery in the Brother Cadfel series, a beautiful widow rents part of her estate to the brothers of Shrewsbury Abbey for the modest sum of one rose from a certain bush, per year, and all are happy with this arrangement for three years. But then Brother Eluric,the young monk whose job it is to deliver the rose on the day of St. Winifred's translation (the pre-arranged rent-paying day) asks to be excused from the task (he finds he's starting to fall in love with the widow); he is later found murdered near the recently ruined rose rent bush. The abbey is thrown into a panic; not only has an innocent young monk been killed, but with no rose to pay the rent, the contract is canceled and the widow's wealth multiplies remarkably. Soon, the widow herself disappears, and Brother Cadfel begins his search for her and for Eluric's murderer, casting his eye over a large collection of suitors, all of whom would gain greatly from a match with the widow.

The "breaking of the Maya code" has completely changed our knowledge of this ancient civilization, and has given the Maya people a long and vivid history lacking in other areas of the pre-Columbian New World. In the recent past, a working knowledge of this script has been confined to epigraphers, art historians, and other specialists. Its very unfamiliarity to the general public, and the daunting aspect of its approximately 800 signs, have made the system appear more complex and arcane than it really is. <i>Reading the Maya Glyphs</i> is a compact, portable guide that enables students, tourists, and armchair travelers to read and understand commonly encountered Classic Maya texts. Illustrated by the drawings of Mark Van Stone, one of America's most gifted calligraphers, it presupposes no previous training in Maya epigraphy or archaeology. In the hands of visitors to the great Maya sites of Mexico and Central America, or consulted by museum-goers, this guide will enhance appreciation of some of the world's greatest art and architecture. Topics covered include the nature of the language and the writing system, the intricate Maya calendar, dynastic and political texts, and the Maya natural and supernatural world. Informed by the latest research on the script, <i>Reading the Maya Glyphs</i> is a window on the vanished world of the ancient Maya rulers and their people. Illustrated in 2 colors throughout.</p><p><b>Michael D. Coe</b> is Charles J. MacCurdy Professor of Anthropology, Emeritus, Yale University. In 1986 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1989 received the Tatiana Proskouriakoff Award from Harvard University for distinction in Mesoamerican Research. Trained as a type designer, carver, and art historian, <b>Mark Van Stone</b> is an internationally-respected calligrapher and scholar of Maya writing.Although most Mayan inscriptions have been deciphered within the last 30 years, very little has been written for the general reader interested in learning to read these ancient hieroglyphics. To remedy this, anthropologist Coe (Breaking the Maya Code) and calligrapher Van Stone have put together this illustrated manual. After an introductory chapter on Mayan history and culture, an overview is given of Mayan script, phonetics, and morphology, which readers need to study carefully with the help of the syllabary and lexicon provided in the appendix. The authors then go on to introduce glyphs, elaborating on subjects like time, the Mayan calendar, royalty, places, titles, relationships, warfare, scribes and artists, ceramic texts, religion, and nature. Also provided are exercises, a discussion of formulae and tables for calendrical calculations, references to software programs, and suggestions for further study. Although no previous knowledge of Mayan culture or language is assumed, this is not a simple primer to take on a trip to the Yucat n. Some background reading, especially on the Mayan calendar and Mayan history, is needed to benefit fully from this manual. For academic and large public libraries. Lucille M.

He stops being fun so Beaumont wants to kill him.</p><p>In 1985, 39-year-old Stephen King announced in public that his pseudonymous alter ego, Richard Bachman, was dead. (Never mind that he revived him years later to write <i>The Regulators</i>.) At the beginning of <i>The Dark Half</i> (1989), 39-year-old writer Thad Beaumont announces in public that his own pseudonym, George Stark, is dead. <p> Now, King didn't want to jettison the Bachman novel, titled <i>Machine Dreams</i>, that was he working on. So he incorporated it in <i>The Dark Half</i> as the crime oeuvre of George Stark, whose recurring hero/alter ego is an evil character named Alexis Machine.</p><p> Thad Beaumont's pseudonym is not so docile as Stephen King's, though, and George Stark bursts forth into reality. At that point, two stories kick into gear: a mystery-detective story about the crime spree of George Stark (or is it Alexis Machine?) and a horror story about Beaumont's struggle to catch up with his doppelganger and kill him dead.</p><p> This is not the first time that Stephen King has written a dark allegory about the fiction writer's situation. As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "<i>Misery</i> (1987) is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death. <i>The Dark Half</i> is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes, the fratricidal twin who occupies 'the womblike dungeon' of his imagination." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.</p><h2>A Day With Wilbur Robinson</h2><p>While spending the day in the Robinson household, Wilbur&#39;s best friend joins in the search for Grandfather Robinson&#39;s missing false teeth and meets one wacky relative after another</p><p><p>William Joyce lives in Shreveport, Louisiana, with his lovely wife, Elizabeth, and their children, Mary Katherine and Jack. They also have a dachshund named Rose and something else named Rex. Mr. Joyce has produced two animated television shows based on his books: <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> and <em>George Shrinks</em>. He also produced and designed the animated feature film <em>Robots</em>. Every once in a while he does a cover for <em>The New Yorker</em>. His alarmingly optimistic picture books include <em>Dinosaur Bob and His Adventures with the Family Lazardo, Santa Calls, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs,</em> and <em>Bently &amp; Egg</em>.He is currently futzing around on several books and stories that embrace the alleged healing power of heroically scaled silliness.</p>The Robinson's house is not like anyone else's because Wilbur's family is not like any other. The slim plot that involves Wilbur and his visiting friend looking for Grandfather's lost false teeth is just a device to introduce the wonderfully weird family members. Most of the jokes are only in the pictures, while the restrained, slightly tongue-in-cheek text provides a satisfying contrast. The text states that Aunt Billie is playing with her train set, Cousin Pete is walking the cats, and Uncle Art has just arrived from abroad, but the trains are shown as full sized, the cats are tigers, and Uncle Art is stepping out of a flying saucer. The illustrative style is reminiscent in both color and form of 1940s advertising art. Many details such as hairstyles, clothing, and even a robot seem influenced by that period. In keeping with the advertising look, the layout is open and spacious. Although the figures often appear frozen in a pose, even when gesticulating, and the two boys are mainly passive observers except in a close-up of a wild pillow fight, the imaginative details and the changing perspectives keep the pictures interesting. Children may not realize that the dancing frogs are watching Fred Astaire movies or that sister has a model of the Empire State building for a headdress--these jokes are for adults--but they will enjoy the imaginative play and delight in filling in the text. --Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arnold Schwarzenegger: A Portrait</h2><p>Reveals the life and career of bodybuilder-turned-actor, detailing his years of competition, his acting and business careers, and his marriage to Maria Shriver</p><p></p><h2>Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman&#39;s Last Journey</h2><p>A close friend of physicist Richard Feynman chronicles his relationship with the scientist and describes their ten-year quest to reach the remote country of Tannu Tuva</p><p>Richard Feynman, brilliant physicist and inspirational teacher, wasn't much for coats and ties. He lived a life that the adjective "bohemian" doesn't begin to cover, scripting percussion scores for avant-garde ballet troupes, musing over life's imponderables, and delighting and annoying his many friends with odd-duck questions--all the while teaching generations of students at CalTech.<p> Always adventurous, Feynman was also a careful planner, recounts his friend and fellow drummer Ralph Leighton in this affectionate memoir. When a chance remark happened to dislodge a long-dormant memory of a faraway Siberian land called Tannu-Tuva, Feynman and Leighton set about scheming to get there--a program that included learning the little-described Tuvan language, picking up the rudiments of throat singing, and reading the scattered, hard-to-find literature concerning a place that, in Feynman's fond view, was as close to paradise as the earth contained. It also involved corresponding with scholars in what was still the Soviet Union and wrangling with bureaucrats to secure the necessary papers--all for the sake of seeing a country that had to be interesting, Feynman insisted, just because its capital, Kyzyl, had such an odd spelling.</p><p> These picaresque armchair adventures make up the bulk of <i>Tuva or Bust</i>, an unconventional mix of travelogue and scientific biography that's a pleasure to read at every turn. The book yields a memorable picture of Richard Feynman--who did not live to see Tuva, but whose memory is honored there today, thanks to Leighton's refusal to abandon their shared dream. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Richard Feynman was born on May 11, 1918 in Brooklyn, NY. He attended MIT and was awarded his Ph.D. from Princeton University. During World War II, he participated in the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. After the war, he accepted a teaching position at Cornell University, and in 1950, he accepted a position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He remained there until his death in 1988. Feynman is well-known for his work in quantumelectrodynamics (QED), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He also contributed to the understanding of superfluidity in liquid helium and the underlying causes of the Challenger shuttle explosion. Feynman reached popular audiences through his semi-autobiographical books, and is respected for his humor, storytelling, and bongo playing. He is considered by many to be the greatest and most popular physicist in modern times.</p><h2>The Mind of Christ: The Transforming Power of Thinking His Thoughts</h2><p>With this new edition of The Mind of Christ, readers will find themselves embarking on the never-ending quest to become more like Jesus.&nbsp;This book helps Christians understand how God works within them and transforms them, continually renewing and reshaping their minds to reflect the mind of Christ more closely.</p><p><b>Claude King</b>&nbsp;es el editor en jefe del departamento de Recursos sin fecha en Lifeway.

In <i>Refusing Heaven</i>, Gilbert writes compellingly about the commingled passion, loneliness, and sometimes surprising happiness of a life spent in luminous understanding of his own blessings and shortcomings: &#x201c;The days and nights wasted . . . Long hot afternoons / watching ants while the cicadas railed / in the Chinese elm about the brevity of life.&#x201d; Time slows down in these poems, as Gilbert creates an aura of curiosity and wonder at the fact of existence itself. Despite powerful intermittent griefs&#x2013;over the women he has parted from or the one lost to cancer (an experience he captures with intimate precision)&#x2013;Gilbert&#x2019;s choice in this volume is to &#x201c;refuse heaven.&#x201d; He prefers this life, with its struggle and alienation and delight, to any paradise. His work is both a rebellious assertion of the call to clarity and a profound affirmation of the world in all its aspects. It braces the reader in its humanity and heart.</p><p>Jack Gilbert was born in Pittsburgh. He is the author of <i>The Great Fires: Poems 1982&#x2014;1992</i>; <i>Monolithos</i>, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; and <i>Views of Jeopardy</i>, the 1962 winner of the Yale Younger Poets Prize.

The last practitioner of an honored, centuries-old tradition, the <em>Seanchai</em> enthralls his assembled audience for three evenings running with narratives of foolish kings and fabled saints, of enduring accomplishments and selfless acts -- until he is banished from the household for blasphemy and moves on. But these three incomparable nights have changed young Ronan forever, setting him on the course he will follow for years to come -- as he pursues the elusive, itinerant storyteller . . . and the magical tales that are no less than the glorious saga of his tenacious, troubled, and extraordinary isle.</p></p><p><p>Frank Delaney was born in Tipperary, Ireland. A career in broadcasting earned him fame across the United Kingdom. A judge for the Booker Prize, several of his nonfiction books were bestsellers in the UK, and he writes frequently for American and British publications. He now lives with his wife, Diane Meier, in New York and Connecticut. <em>Ireland</em> is his first novel to be published in the United States.</p>When a storyteller comes to visit young Ronan's house, he becomes fascinated with the wanderer's art. His mother is less fascinated, throwing the man out and spawning a search for the man and Ronan's lifelong fascination with storytelling and Irish history. The stories form the backbone of the novel as Ronan traces the man's tales and tries a few of his own. Frank Delaney wrote with the ear in mind, and as narrator he uses his gentle, thoughtful voice to full effect. Like his fictional storyteller, he draws listeners in with the two-part goal of telling truths with a good story and keeping listeners driven to know what happens next. Rather than a must-read, this novel is a must-listen. J.A.S.

Ignazio Silone, author of one of the great novels of the 1930s, <i>Bread and Wine</i>, returned from exile. Alberto Moravia, who helped define the modern conscience with his novel <i>The Time of Indifference</i>, left the mountains outside Rome, where he had been hiding from the Germans. Rome filled with veterans of the partisan war, of the underground, of the anonymity and silence of the Italian police state. The suffering of the war, the bold hopes which blossomed after Fascism's overthrow, were described in a torrent of films, stories and novels, bringing a kind of climax to one of the great national literatures of the twentieth century.<br>William Weaver, who drove an ambulance for the British Army during the war, also arrived in Rome in the late 1940s, fell in love with the Italian language and literature, and found a career in translating the writers he met there. <i>Open City</i> is an anthology of the writers Weaver admired most, described in a long introductory memoir - Silone, Moravia, Elsa Morante, Carlo Levi, Giorgio Bassani, Natalia Ginzburg, Carlo Emilio Gadda. No other book offers such a comprehensive sampling of the political seriousness and lyrical realism which were the gift of the Italians to modern writing.</p><p><i>Traddutore, traditore</i>, goes the old Italian proverb: To translate is to betray. But William Weaver, who has assembled a fine anthology of contemporary Italian prose in <i>Open City: Seven Writers in Postwar Rome</i>, is anything but treacherous toward his favorites. For one thing, he is our preeminent translator from that euphonious, vowel-encrusted language, and anybody who reads his elegant versions of Italo Calvino or Umberto Eco will recognize what a great service he has performed to these high-wire stylists--not to mention their readers.<p> But as Weaver's preface-cum-memoir makes clear, he is not merely a linguistic loyalist. During the late 1940s and '50s, when the young translator lived in Rome, he got to know all the contributors to <i>Open City</i>: Ignazio Silone, Giorgio Bassani, Alberto Moravia, Elsa Morante, Natalia Ginzburg, Carlo Levi, and Carlo Emiliano Gadda. This anthology, then, is a peculiarly personal one, in which the editor exposes us to both the art and life of each author. It necessarily excludes such giants as Primo Levi, Leonardo Sciascia, and Calvino, none of whom happened to cross Weaver's path during his <i>dolce vita</i> phase. But the septet he has assembled is a splendid one, which suggests that the Eternal City was some kind of literary hot spot in the wake of the Second World War.</p><p> Gadda undoubtedly wins the crown for sheer stylistic extravagance. The excerpt Weaver has chosen from <i>That Awful Mess on Via Merulana</i> gives a vivid sense of the challenges (and rewards!) of that macaronic masterpiece. (It also includes some of the best portraiture of Rome itself, "lying as if on a map or scale model: it smoked slightly, at Porta San Paolo: a clear proximity of infinite thoughts and palaces, which the north wind had cleansed.") At the opposite end of the spectrum is Natalia Ginzburg, whose antirhetorical style still makes most contemporary novelists sound crude and inflationary, especially when it comes to minute discriminations of feeling. And in between, we find such marvels as Moravia's "Agostino" (a cruelly accurate account of childhood's end), Morante's "The Nameless One," and an excerpt from Carlo Levi's <i>The Watch</i>, which dispenses its wisdom casually but hits the bull's-eye every time: </p><blockquote>The world holds us with a thousand ties of habit, work, inertia, affections. It's difficult and painful to separate from them. But as soon as a foot rests on a train, airplane, or automobile that will carry us away, everything disappears, the past becomes remote and is buried, a new time crowded to the brim with unknown promises envelopes us and, entirely free and anonymous, we look around searching for new companions.</blockquote> Weaver's memoir is primarily an elegy for his "lost, open city" and those writers with whom he inhabited it--all but Bassani have died during the succeeding decades. As such, it includes an unmistakable hint of melancholy. But it manages to convey the excitement of the era, too--and the words that Weaver's companions committed to paper are, as <i>Open City</i> demonstrates, very much alive. <i>--James Marcus</i>WILLIAM WEAVER has been the leading translator of Italian writing into English for half a century and several samples of his own work are included in <i>Open City</i>. Among his previous books is <i>A Legacy of Excellence: The Story of Villa I Tatti</i>. Weaver divides his year among Italy, New York City, and Annandale-on-Hudson, where he is on the faculty of Bard College.</p><h2>Roman</h2><p>The film director describes his youth in Nazi Poland, his film directing career, the murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, his arrest on a morals charge, his new acting career, and his films</p><p></p><h2>Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883</h2><p><p>Simon Winchester, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, examines the legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa, which was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogotï¿½ and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today's new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. <em>Krakatoa</em> gives us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event.</p></p><p>It may seem a stretch to connect a volcanic eruption with civil and religious unrest in Indonesia today, but Simon Winchester makes a compelling case. <i>Krakatoa</i> tells the frightening tale of the biggest volcanic eruption in history using a blend of gentle geology and narrative history. Krakatoa erupted at a time when technologies like the telegraph were becoming commonplace and Asian trade routes were being expanded by northern European companies. This bustling colonial backdrop provides an effective canvas for the suspense leading up to August 27th, 1883, when the nearby island of Krakatoa would violently vaporize. Winchester describes the eruption through the eyes of its survivors, and readers will be as horrified and mesmerized as eyewitnesses were as the death toll reached nearly 40,000 (almost all of whom died from tsunamis generated by the unimaginably strong shock waves of the eruption). Ships were thrown miles inshore, endless rains of hot ash engulfed those towns not drowned by 100 foot waves, and vast rafts of pumice clogged the hot sea. The explosion was heard thousands of miles away, and the eruption's shock wave traveled around the world seven times. But the book's biggest surprise is not the riveting catalog of the volcano's effects; rather, it is Winchester's contention that the Dutch abandonment of their Indonesian colonies after the disaster left local survivors to seek comfort in radical Islam, setting the stage for a volatile future for the region. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists. In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen.

TV tie-in. BOMC &amp; History.</p><p>On the morning of June 7, 1942, six months to the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USS <i>Yorktown</i> "turned over on her port side and sank in about 3,000 fathoms of water with all battle flags flying." Many of her men watched from the decks of the <i>Vireo</i>, the <i>Benham</i>, the <i>Hughes</i>, and the <i>Hammann</i>, weeping as the Old Lady went down. The Battle of Midway was finally over. Though the <i>Yorktown</i> was lost, the battle was won--what John Keegan has called "as great a reversal of strategic fortune as the naval world has ever seen." From that point on, the Japanese remained primarily on the defensive at sea.<p> On the morning of May 19, 1998, Robert D. Ballard stared into a video monitor hoping for a glimpse of metal on the bottom of the sea. "Thar she blows! Bingo!" After almost three weeks out, painstakingly scanning the ocean floor with high-altitude sonar, and many months of research and planning, Ballard and his crew had spotted the <i>Yorktown</i> some three miles down. The wreck was in remarkably good condition: "It was as if we had stumbled on the ship a few minutes after it made its death plunge."</p><p> In <i>Return to Midway</i>, Ballard weaves a compelling narrative, blending the story of the famous battle with his battle to find the sunken ships--the <i>Yorktown</i> and the USS <i>Hammann</i>, as well as four Japanese aircraft carriers. First-hand accounts by the men who were there, including two Japanese and two American servicemen who joined Ballard and his crew for the hunt, as well as paintings and archival photographs, detail the battle in all its horror, while capturing the honor of the men who fought on both sides. Military-history buffs will find this book--the first in decades specifically about the Battle of Midway--especially valuable, though fans of Ballard's work as an oceanographer will be equally captivated. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Midway--the name evokes images of insurmountable odds and heroic sacrifice on the part of the U.S. Navy in 1942, for it was this battle (and those of the Coral Sea and Guadalcanal) that stemmed the tide of Japanese aggression in the Pacific and began the march to victory that would end in Tokyo harbor in August 1945. In this rich visual and narrative account, Ballard deftly intersperses chapters on the Battle of Midway with a fascinating account of his search for the U.S.S. Yorktown, which was sunk by a Japanese destroyer on June 7, 1942. Period photographs from the battle are combined with those of the Yorktown as she rests today, and paintings by marine artist Ken Marschall add detail to complete the record. The lively narrative is punctuated with two Japanese and two American oral history accounts of the battle. As with his books on the Titanic, the Bismarck, and the ships of Guadalcanal, Ballard has once again produced a visual tour de force that will evoke memories in those remaining veterans of what the late Gordon W. Prange termed the "miracle at Midway" while firing the imaginations of a younger generation. Highly recommended.<br><i>-Harold N. Boyer, Springfield Twp.

Through all the vicissitudes of its history, the White House has transformed the characters, and often the fates, of its powerful occupants.<br><br>In <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i>, Margaret Truman takes us behind the scenes, into the deepest recesses and onto the airiest balconies, as she reveals what it feels like to live in the White House. Here are hilarious stories of Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s rambunctious children tossing spitballs at presidential portraits&#x2013;as well as a heartbreaking account of the tragedy that befell President Coolidge&#x2019;s young son, Calvin, Jr. Here, too, is the real story of the Lincoln Bedroom and the thrilling narrative of how first lady Dolley Madison rescued a priceless portrait of George Washington and a copy of the Declaration of Independence before British soldiers torched the White House in 1814. <br><br>Today the 132-room White House operates as an exotic combination of first-class hotel and fortress, with 1,600 dedicated workers, an annual budget over $1 billion, and a kitchen that can handle anything from an intimate dinner for four to a reception for 2,400. But ghosts of the past still walk its august corridors&#x2013;including a phantom whose visit President Harry S Truman described to his daughter in eerie detail.<br><br>From the basement swarming with reporters to the Situation Room crammed with sophisticated technology to the Oval Office where the president receives the world&#x2019;s leaders, the White House is a beehive of relentless activity, deal-making, intrigue, gossip, and of course history in the making. In this evocative and insightful book, Margaret Truman combines high-stakes drama with the unique perspective of an insider. The ultimate guided tour of the nation&#x2019;s most famous dwelling, <i>The President&#x2019;s House</i> is truly a national treasure.</p><p><b>Margaret Truman</b> has won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, including her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her previous bestselling biographies are <i>Harry S Truman</i>, <i>Bess W. Truman</i>, and <i>First Ladies</i>. She lives in Manhattan.<b><br>1<br><br>Magic and Mystery in a Unique Place</b><br>The last time I was in Washington, D.C., I walked by the White House on the way to dinner at a nearby restaurant. Hidden floodlights made the historic building glow like a mansion in a vision or a dream. Suddenly I thought: I am not the woman who lived in that house more than fifty years ago. She is a completely different person. I barely know her.<br><br>The words whispered in my mind like a voice from another world. I was remembering, or trying to remember, what it meant to be the daughter of the president of the United States, living in that shining shimmering house. The one inescapable thing I recalled was the difference. I have lived in several houses and apartments, and spent some time in splendid establishments, including a few royal palaces. But not one of them--or all of them together--can compare to the feeling I recalled from my White House days.<br><br>That was when I resolved to write this book about one of the most mysterious, terrifying, exalting, dangerous, fascinating houses in the world. It is a house that has changed people in amazing, unexpected ways. It is a house that has broken hearts and minds. It is a house that has made some people weep when they walked out the door for the last time--and others feel like escapees from a maximum security prison. Some marriages have been saved within those pristine white walls. Others have been irrevocably ruined.<br><br>Children have played marvelously clever games inside and outside this unique piece of architecture. Other children have twisted and turned in their death throes while their weeping parents, arguably the most powerful persons on the North American continent, clutched them in their impotent arms. In those same second-floor bedrooms, radiant brides have dressed in virginal white and descended to meet loving husbands as the world applauded.<br><br>Once, one of these brides married a president. I am speaking of Frances Folsom and Grover Cleveland. A century or so ago, when I was a twenty-something, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Cleveland, who told me the reason she was married in the White House instead of in her family home: Nowhere else could she and the president have their privacy guaranteed.<br><br>The old house is, to put it mildly, a paradoxical place. People who think in straight lines have a very difficult time adjusting to it. And as history has shown again and again, many of them never do. Even so, I think everyone who has ever lived in the White House would agree that it's a special experience--a unique combination of history, tragedy, comedy, melodrama, and the ups and downs of ordinary living all under one roof.<br><b><br>II</b><br>Men bearing that unique title, president of the United States, the office my father called "the greatest in the history of the world," have paced the White House's darkened halls in periods of national crisis, gazing at portraits of their predecessors on the walls, seeking communion with their triumphs--or shuddering at their blunders. Women reached out to these men, trying to offer them guidance, or at the very least solace for their awesome burdens. My mother managed to play both roles in my father's presidency--a feat too many obtuse historians and biographers have failed to recognize.<br><br>In the basement and attic rooms are the memories of the hundreds of other people who lived a large part of their working lives in this unique house, and experienced its aura of power and history. Their stories belong in this book, too. Some, I regret to say, were slaves. But the house, paradoxical as always, gradually became a place where free African-Americans demonstrated their right to equality.<br><br>Maggie Rogers began working as a White House maid when William Howard Taft became president in 1909. Her daughter, Lillian Rogers Parks, was hired as a seamstress at the White House in 1929 and worked until the end of the Eisenhower administration in 1961. Growing up, Lillian once asked her mother if she would be happier (and better paid) at some millionaire's mansion elsewhere in the capital. Maggie Rogers scorned the idea. "Heavens no, child! Be it ever so elegant, there's no place like the White House. Why, I'm living history!" There was black pride and White House pride achieving a magical fusion.<br><br>Also worth commemorating are the efforts of the dedicated, courageous, amazingly patient men who have struggled to keep presidents and their families alive in the often malevolent glare of public criticism and spasms of national hatred. We know them now as members of the Secret Service. But their predecessors are equally memorable, standing guard at the White House's doors in suits that were a size too large for them--to conceal their pistols. Most people, including some of the presidents they guarded, were unaware of those hidden weapons.<br><br>There is a side to these protectors that few people know about, much less appreciate--the many acts of kindness and thoughtfulness they perform for presidents and first ladies. Perhaps the most touching story comes from the sad days of President Woodrow Wilson's decline. Felled by a stroke, he sank into near despair as Congress rejected his dream of world peace embodied in the League of Nations.<br><br>When the crippled president went for a ride in the afternoon, the Secret Service used to round up a small crowd of government employees and strolling tourists, who waited at the White House gate to cheer him when he returned. It was a pathetic illusion, but a testament to how much these men cared about the president.<br><b><br>III<br></b><br>Perhaps the most intriguing White House denizens are the men and women who have worked beside presidents as their spokespersons or confidential advisers. More than anyone, they often shared the reflected glow of White House power. Not all of them were able to deal with it rationally or responsibly, though the vast majority have managed it. For many of them, the experience was more than a little harrowing--and in a few cases, fatal.<br><br>I am thinking of one of my most heartbreaking White House memories--the death of my father's boyhood friend and press secretary, Charlie Ross. Charlie went through high school with Harry Truman and went on to become a top-ranked Washington, D.C., reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. When my father turned to him for help in 1945, Charlie gave up a comfortable salary and rational hours for the ordeal of a White House in which clocks and sensible schedules ceased to exist. Five exhausting years later, during the frantic early months of the Korean War, when newsmen besieged the White House twenty-four hours a day, Charlie Ross collapsed and died of a heart attack at his desk. A weeping Harry Truman said the country had lost a great public servant--and he had lost his best friend.<br><b><br>IV</b><br>That memory leads us to another cadre of White House inhabitants, although many presidents and their families might be reluctant to bestow that title on them: the men and women of the media. They, too, participate in the aura of the White House--to the point where they sometimes act as if they run the place. I had a vivid reminder of this mind-set when I came to the White House to talk with Hillary Clinton in 1994 about my book in progress, First Ladies.<br><br>A badly misinformed White House policeman told me to enter the mansion through the press briefing room in the West Wing. The minute I stepped through the doorway, a half dozen reporters surrounded me. Why was I there? To advise Hillary on how to improve her performance as First Lady? What did I think of Hillary's latest hairstyle? Should she hold more press conferences ^ la Eleanor Roosevelt, or fewer ^ la Bess Truman (who held none at all)? I smiled sweetly and said "No comment" to these attempts to get me to put my foot in my mouth.<br><br>My favorite White House media story comes from my friend President Gerald Ford. Gerry says he and veteran newswoman Helen Thomas were strolling on a street near the White House when he saw one of those old-fashioned scales that gave you your fortune and weight for a penny. Gerry read the little fortune card aloud: "You are a marvelous orator and leader of men. Your future in your chosen career could not be brighter."<br><br>Helen, looking over his shoulder, said: "It's got your weight wrong, too."<br><br>As the wife (now widow) of a newspaperman, I recognize the necessity for such irreverence. As the daughter of a president, I don't have to like it. But I am prepared to include it, somewhat ruefully, in the White House's story.<br><b><br>V</b><br>The White House is far more than the place where presidents and hundreds of staffers work and presidential families live. It is also the place where America's pride and dignity as a sovereign nation are displayed. At official dinners and receptions, when the president enters the room to the U.S. Marine Band's resounding "Hail to the Chief," people recognize not only a powerful man but the nation, the United States of America. The immense amount of time and effort that presidents and first ladies and the White House staff devote to entertaining visitors from around the country and the world is a fascinating and important story. It, too, is part of the White House aura.<br><br>What a roster these visitors constitute! They range from the king and queen of England, whose snobbish servants started an uncivil war with the White House staff, to Russian grand dukes and Japanese noblemen, from world renowned politicians such as Winston Churchill, who gave himself a mild heart attack trying to open his bedroom window, to Cherokee and Creek and Sioux Indian chiefs, who did war dances on the lawn. Marvelous musicians such as pianist Vladimir Horowitz, soprano Jessye Norman, and cellist Pablo Casals (who performed for the Theodore Roosevelts in 1901 and for the John F. Kennedys sixty years later) have filled presidential ears with beautiful music. Entertainers such as Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand...</p><h2>Double Wager (Signet Regency Romance)</h2><p>The tomboyish, headstrong young Henrietta wagers her most precious possession that she can marry the most worldly, bored and sought-after lord in Regency London, the Duke of Eversleigh</p><p></p><h2>Dynamic Color Painting for the Beginner</h2><p>Painting in oil or acrylics is one of the most popular of the fine arts, with an enormous body of lore for the aspiring painter to master.

It was the early 1920s and Masao had dreams for the future--and a fascination with the politics and opportunities of a world that was changing every day.

It was August 1941.<br><br>From the ship, she went directly to the Palo Alto home of her uncle, Takeo, and his family. To Hiroko, California was a different world--a world of barbeques, station wagons and college. Her cousins in California had become more American than Japanese.

And at twenty-six, after having taught at the university in Kyoto for two years, he had found her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was delicate and shy, and yet she was fascinated by the things he said, and several times, through the go-between, she had asked him interesting questions, about his work, his family, and even about Kyoto.&nbsp;&nbsp;She rarely raised her eyes to look at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet once, he had seen her glance at him, with excruciating shyness, and he thought her incredibly lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She stood beside him now, six months after the day they met, with her eyes cast down, wearing the heavy white kimono her grandmother had worn, with the same elaborate gold brocade <i>obi</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A tiny dagger hung from it, so she could take her own life, should Masao decide that he did not want her.&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her carefully groomed hair, she wore the <i>tsunokakushi</i>, which covered her head but not her face, and made her seem even tinier as he watched her.&nbsp;&nbsp;And hanging just below the <i>tsunokakushi</i> were the <i>kan zaslin</i>, the delicate hair ornaments that had been her mother's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother had also given her a huge princess ball, made of silk threads and heavily embroidered over the course of Hidemi's lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother had started it when Hidemi was born and added to it through the years, always praying that Hidemi would be gracious, noble, and wise.&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess ball was the most treasured gift her mother could give her, an exquisite symbol of her love and prayers, and hopes for her future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Masao wore the traditional black kimono with a coat over it, bearing his family's crest, as he stood proudly beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully they each took three sips of sake from three cups, and the Shinto ceremony continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had been to the Shinto shrine earlier that day for a private ceremony, and this one was the formal public marriage that would join them forever, in front of all their family and friends, as the master of the ceremony told stories about both families and their histories both of their families were present, and several of the professors Masao taught with in Kyoto.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only his cousin Takeo was not there.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was five years older than Masao, and was his closest friend, and he would have wanted to be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Takeo had gone to the United States the year before, to teach at Stanford University, in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a great opportunity for him, and Masao wished he could have joined him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The ceremony was extremely solemn and very long, and never once did Hidemi raise her eyes to look at him, or even smile, as they became man and wife, according to the most venerable Shinto traditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the ceremony, at last she hesitantly looked up at him, and the smallest of smiles lit her eyes and then her face, as she bowed low to her new husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;Masao bowed to her as well, and then she was led away by her mother and her sisters to exchange her white kimono for a red one for the reception.&nbsp;&nbsp;In wealthy city families, the bride changed her kimono six or seven times in the course of her wedding, but in their <i>buraku</i>, two kimonos had seemed enough for Hidemi.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It was a perfect day for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a beautiful summer day, and the fields of Ayabe were the color of emeralds.&nbsp;&nbsp;They spent the entire afternoon greeting their friends, and accepting the many gifts offered them, and the gifts of money carefully wrapped, and handed to Masao.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>There was music, and many friends, and dozens of distant relatives and cousins. Hidemi's cousin from Fukuoka played the <i>koto</i>, and a pair of dancers performed a slow and graceful <i>bugaku</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was endless food as well. Especially the traditional tempura, rice balls, <i>kuri shioyaki</i>, chicken, sashimi, red rice with <i>nasu</i>, <i>nishoga</i>, and <i>narazuke</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were delicacies that had been prepared for days by Hidemi's aunts and mother. Her grandmother, "abaachan," had overseen all the preparations herself; she was pleased that her little granddaughter was getting married.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the right age, and she had learned her lessons well.&nbsp;&nbsp;She would be a good wife for anyone, and the family was pleased with the alliance with Masao, in spite of his reputation for being fascinated by modern concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidemi's father was amused by him; Masao liked to discuss world politics and speak of wordly things.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was also well versed in all the important traditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a good family, and he was an honorable young man, and they all felt certain that he would make her an excellent husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Masao and Hidemi spent the first night of their marriage with her family, and then left for Kyoto the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wearing a beautiful pink-and-red kimono her mother had given her, and she looked especially lovely as Masao drove her away in the brand-new 1922 Model T coupe he had borrowed for the occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;It belonged to an American professor at the university in Kyoto. <br><br>And when they returned to Kyoto they settled into his small, spare home, and Hidemi proved everything he had believed about her from the moment he met her. She kept his house immaculate for him, and observed all of the familiar traditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to the nearby shrine regularly, and was polite and hospitable to all of his colleagues whenever he brought them home for dinner. And she was always deeply respectful of Masao.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when she was feeling particularly bold, she giggled at him, particularly when he insisted on speaking to her in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was extremely important that she learn another language, and he spoke to her on many subjects: of the British running Palestine, of Gandhi in India, and even about Mussolini.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were events happening in the world that he thought she should know about, and his insistence on it amused her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very good to her in many ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was gentle and kind and considerate, and he told her often that he hoped they would have many children.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was deeply embarrassed when he spoke of such things, but when she dared, she whispered to him that she hoped she would bring him many sons, and great honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Daughters are honorable too, Hidemi-san," he said gently, and she looked at him in amazement.&nbsp;&nbsp;She would have been deeply ashamed to give him only daughters.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew the importance of bearing sons, particularly coming from a farm community like Ayabe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She was a sweet girl, and in the ensuing months they became good friends, as they learned to love each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was gentle and thoughtful with her, and always deeply touched by her myriad delicate gestures.&nbsp;&nbsp;She always had wonderful meals waiting for him, and flowers, perfectly arranged--particularly in the <i>tokonoma</i>, the alcove where the painted scroll was kept, which was their home's most important and honored decoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>She learned what he liked, and what he didn't, and was careful to shield him from the most minor annoyance.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the perfect wife for him, and as the months wore on, he was ever more pleased that he had found her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was still as shy as she had been at first, but he sensed that she was growing more comfortable with him, and more at ease in his world.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had even learned a handful of phrases in English to please him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He still spoke to her only in English at night when they shared dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he spoke to her often of his cousin Takeo in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was happy with his job at the university, and had just married a <i>kibei</i>, a girl who had been born in the States of a Japanese family, but had been sent to Japan to complete her education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeo had said in his letters that she was a nurse, her name was Reiko, and her family was from Tokyo.&nbsp;&nbsp;And more than o...</p><h2>Korea - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture (45)</h2><p>Apart from the headline-making politics, not much is known in the West about the Korean people and their ancient culture.

The standoff between the two countries of the Korean Peninsula is a legacy of the Cold War and a potential flashpoint for future conflict. Despite a brief thaw in relations a few years ago, the Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the north, a secretive single-party socialist state with a centralized industrial economy, conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. The Republic of Korea (ROK) in the south meanwhile, a free market democracy, has become a rising economic power, and in 2010 became the first former aid recipient to join the OECD Development Assistance Committee. Much has changed since the first edition of <i>Culture Smart! Korea</i> was published in 2005: the North&#x2019;s defiant development of its nuclear program, the end of the South&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sunshine&#x201d; or engagement policy in 2008, the opening up to US tourists by the North in 2010, and the death of its leader Kim Jong Il in 2011 and the succession of his youngest son, Kim Jong Un. This new, updated edition of <i>Culture Smart! Korea</i> looks at the changing social and economic situation and provides real insights into thinking and behavior in both countries. It indicates the pitfalls to avoid, and introduces you to some of the many delights of the Korean peninsula.</p><p><b>James Hoare</b> spent over thirty years in the British Diplomatic Service, with postings to Seoul and Beijing.&nbsp; His last job was Chargï¿½ D&#x2019;Affaires in Pyongyang, North Korea, where he established the British Embassy.

She casts new light on Dickinson's temperament, her aesthetic sensibility, and her vision of the relationship between art and nature, revealing that the successful gardener's intimate understanding of horticulture helped shape the poet's choice of metaphors for every experience: love and hate, wickedness and virtue, death and immortality. </p><p> </p><p> Gardening, Farr demonstrates, was Dickinson's other vocation, more public than the making of poems but analogous and closely related to it. Over a third of Dickinson's poems and nearly half of her letters allude with passionate intensity to her favorite wildflowers, to traditional blooms like the daisy or gentian, and to the exotic gardenias and jasmines of her conservatory. Each flower was assigned specific connotations by the nineteenth century floral dictionaries she knew; thus, Dickinson's association of various flowers with friends, family, and lovers, like the tropes and scenarios presented in her poems, establishes her participation in the literary and painterly culture of her day. A chapter, "Gardening with Emily Dickinson" by Louise Carter, cites family letters and memoirs to conjecture the kinds of flowers contained in the poet's indoor and outdoor gardens. Carter hypothesizes Dickinson's methods of gardening, explaining how one might grow her flowers today. </p><p> </p><p> Beautifully illustrated and written with verve, <i>The Gardens of Emily Dickinson</i> will provide pleasure and insight to a wide audience of scholars, admirers of Dickinson's poetry, and garden lovers everywhere. </p></p><p>Cuttings from the book:&#34;The pansy, like the anemone, was a favorite of Emily Dickinson because it came up early, announcing the longed-for spring, and, as a type of bravery, could withstand cold and even an April snow flurry or two in her Amherst garden. In her poem the pansy announces itself boldly, telling her it has been &#39;resoluter&#39; than the &#39;Coward Bumble Bee&#39; that loiters by a warm hearth waiting for May.&#34;&#34;She spoke of the written word as a flower, telling Emily Fowler Ford, for example, &#39;thank you for writing me, one precious little &#34;forget-me-not&#34; to bloom along my way.&#39; She often spoke of a flower when she meant herself: &#39;You failed to keep your appointment with the apple-blossoms,&#39; she reproached her friend Maria Whitney in June 1883, meaning that Maria had not visited her . . . Sometimes she marked the day or season by alluding to flowers that had or had not bloomed: &#39;I said I should send some flowers this week . . . [but] my Vale Lily asked me to wait for her.&#39;&#34;&#34;People were also associated with flowers . . . Thus, her loyal, brisk, homemaking sister Lavinia is mentioned in Dickinson&#39;s letters in concert with sweet apple blossoms and sturdy chrysanthemums . . . Emily&#39;s vivid, ambitious sister-in-law Susan Dickinson is mentioned in the company of cardinal flowers and of that grand member of the fritillaria family, the Crown Imperial.&#34;Judith Farr is Professor Emerita of English &amp; American Literature at Georgetown University.<br><br>Louise Carter is a professional landscape gardener and horticulturalist.</p><h2>Scalia Dissents: Writings of the Supreme Court&#39;s Wittiest, Most Outspoken Justice</h2><p>Brilliant. Colorful. Visionary. Tenacious. Witty. Since his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1986, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia has been described as all of these things and for good reason. He is perhaps the best-known justice on the Supreme Court today and certainly the most controversial. Yet most Americans have probably not read even one of his several hundred Supreme Court opinions. In Scalia Dissents, Kevin Ring, former counsel to the U.S. Senate's Constitution Subcommittee, lets Justice Scalia speak for himself.

Married, wealthy, and the famed discoverer of that eighteenth-century adventuress, Lady Charlotte Wilcox, she ought to be content. Instead, she is horrified to find herself profoundly in love with twenty-six-year-old Oliver, the son of her oldest friend. When Marian's cousin, the snobbish Barton, announces his engagement to Sophie, a graduate student in Marian's department, Marian, Oliver and Sophie find their affiars woefully entangled, and their hearts turned in unfamiliar directions. All three of them will learn that love may seldom be straightforward, but it's always a gift.</p><p>From the West Village to the Upper East Side, from the Hamptons to Millbrook, The White Rose is at once a nuanced and affectionate reimagining of Strauss' beloved opera, Der Rosenkavalier, and a mesmerizing novel of our own time and place.</p></p><p>Jean Hanff Korelitz lives in Princeton, NJ, with her husband, the Irish poet Paul Muldoon, and their children. She is the author of the novels The Sabbathday River and A Jury of Her Peers, as well as Interference Powder, a novel for children.Korelitz, known for her intelligent thrillers (<i>The Sabbathday River</i>, etc.), strikes off in a new direction with this mordant story of aging, love and self-discovery, a reimagining of the Strauss opera <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> set in upper-class Jewish New York City. Marian Kahn, gracefully aging at 48, is a respected history professor at Columbia, author of a bestselling book of popular history and solidly ensconced in a satisfactory if not brilliant marriage when suddenly she's swept away by the wild but dangerous joy of an affair with the son of her oldest friend. Twenty-six-year-old Oliver, owner of a flower shop called the White Rose, is truly in love, but when he meets graduate student and heiress Sophie Klein, the fiancï¿½e of Marian's pompous cousin, Barton Ochstein, he's blindsided and must question his still strong love for Marian. Sophie is swept away, too, by the knowledge that she may want something more out of life than the academic satisfaction she derives from the study of her own White Rose, a group of German dissidents who agitated against the Nazis. The belief that love always involves sacrifice and is worth the sacrifice it demands drives this warm, worldly novel. Even when their own comfort is at stake, Korelitz's characters succumb to generous impulses, making this a satisfying, emotionally rich read. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She is the author-illustrator of <i>Stella&#x2019;s Starliner</i> and <i>Love Waves,</i> the creator of the beloved Max and Ruby stories, and the illustrator of <i>My Very First Mother Goose </i>and <i>Here Comes Mother Goose, </i>both edited by Iona Opie. Rosemary Wells lives in a small town in New England.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Wells, known for portraying adorable fuzzy-faced animal characters with endearing and oftentimes assertive qualities, introduces Felix, an agreeable guinea pig who becomes immediate best friends with Fiona. The minute the bond is established, Fiona declares that her new buddy will join her in the big talent show as a pixie at the Guinea Pig Jubilee. She never gives Felix much of a choice when she teaches him the Texas slide step and how to in-line dance in costume, but far worse is when he is teased as being a "Twinkletoes" and mercilessly bullied by classmates. Only when Felix learns what it means to "stand tall" and face his antagonists with a "Magic Protection Suit" does he rise above his circumstances, even voicing his own opinion to slightly bossy Fiona. Wells's characteristic illustrations are enhanced to a meaningful level with a story that emphasizes how to meet the challenges of bullying without fighting back by tongue or fist. At a time when bullying is on the rise from as early as preschool, this book serves a vital purpose, further demonstrating minimal parental involvement beyond Mama Guinea Pig urging her "angel" to "stand tall" and face his own problems.

Now with super-cool foil covers! Shiny! Fun!<br><br>Oh, no! It's not enough that George and Harold have invented Captain Underpants, the greatest superhero of all time, and that they've also saved the world FIVE times! They defeated Dr. Diaper! They punished Professor Poopypants! And they whacked the wicked Wedgie Woman! What task could be worse?!!?<br> This one: As punishment, the boys have to write a 100-page report on "good citizenship," and they have been specifically ordered NOT to write another comic about Captain Underpants. So what do they do?<br> Aha! Meet Super Diaper Baby--the most powerful peewee to pack a punch. With Pilkey's typical over-the-edge humor, Super Diaper Baby will have kids laughing until soda comes out their noses.</p><p>Move over, Captain Underpants! There's a tiny new superhero in town. Undaunted by Principal Krupp's insistence that their essay assignment on good citizenship <i>not</i> be another comic book about the briefs-clad warrior, fourth graders George and Harold decide to invent a new superhero. Super Diaper Baby is born! It's up to our fearless infant hero to save the planet from diabolical Deputy Doo-Doo and his reluctantly evil pooch, Danger Dog ("I'm not really evil. I'm just in it for the kibbles."). Several robotic battles, intergalactic digressions, and "flip-o-ramas" later, Super Diaper Baby has done his duty, and George and Harold are in trouble yet again with their principal. Still, it was worth it, as any fan of Dav Pilkey's lowbrow, scatologically inclined "epic novels" (<i>The Adventures of Captain Underpants</i>, <i>Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman</i>, etc.) will attest. George and Harold's spelling is atrocious, their humor is straight off the grade school playground, and kids love every page of it.

I guess it's because I based both of them on myself when I was a kid. So when I started working on this book, I needed to "become" George and Harold. In my imagination, I stopped being me, and sort of let George and Harold take over. I let them create the story they wanted, without worrying about spelling, or grammar, or moralistic plots which would please adults."</i> <b>-- Dav Pilkey</b><br><b> </b><br> Dav was also inspired by the home-made comic books he receives from kids every day. <br> <i></i><i>"The comics that kids send me often have poor grammar and misspelled words, and usually have bad guys who are disgusting in one way or another.

This new edition from City Light Books adds one more, found among Kerouac&#x2019;s papers by John Sampas, concluding 'Eyes of Ray Charles see Me here realize O Holy.' Mostly written during April 1956 when Kerouac shared a shack with Gary Snyder in rural Mill Valley, outside San Francisco, <i>Old Angel Midnight</i> was likely facilitated by the 'letting go' technique he observed from Snyder&#x2019;s Buddhist meditation. Kerouac described this as 'multilingual sound representing the haddal-da-babra of babbling world tongues coming in through my window.' Onomatopoeic sounds of trees, birds and deer intermingle with childhood flashbacks and in-jokes about his current lovers, friends and rivals. Assonantal and alliterative effects abound: 'perts parts pans pools palls pails parturiences and petty Thieveries that turn into heavenly Buddha.' The stream of mixed-up language is habitually libidinous, peppered by Joycean wordplay ('Taxi crabs &amp; murdercycles'), an orgy of made-up words that culminate in pure sound: 'ampho andiam yerka yama chelmsford alya booneavance koroom cemada versel.&#x201d;&#x2013;&#x2013;Jules Smith, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></p>"Never before has inconsequentiality been raised to such a peak that it becomes a breakthrough," poet McClure writes in one of this volume's two prefaces. Culled from five notebooks, the writing presented here--one continuous prose poem--spans 1956-59, a period when Kerouac (1922-1969) had immersed himself in Buddhist theory. Offbeat, sometimes preposterous references to religion are to be found throughout: "This holy and all universe is a wonderful white wild power, why, hell, should, heaven, interfere, words, waiting, flesh, sure, I know . . ." While it seems redundant to call anything by Kerouac "spontaneous," Beat critic and biographer Charters points out that Kerouac ( On the Road ) conceived of this work as a map of his subconscious, "without the end or narrative direction" that his novels often groped for. Thus even more unconstrained, he plays with words, puns, delights in juxtaposed sounds, invents new words and throws in foreign ones almost at random: "Shoot, pot, proms were flowery purple lilac Richmond eve roadsters redlegs sweetdolls . . ." Like Kerouac's other manuscripts, this material was kept from publication until after his widow's death. At the time of its writing, this volume might have been considered an experimental "breakthrough," but it feels tired and trite now. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bull of Heaven: The Mythic Life of Eddie Buczynski and the Rise of the New York Pagan</h2><p>As a teenager, Eddie Buczynski had dreamed of becoming a Jesuit Priest. Rejected by the Church because of his questioning mind and budding homosexuality, his feet were soon set on a different path-one that would lead from his childhood home in Ozone Park to the raucous streets of '60s Greenwich Village, through the burgeoning Neo-Pagan spiritual movement of the '70s, before depositing him into the academic realm of Classical &amp; Near Eastern archaeology. Bringing together the threads of disparate subcultures, social movements, spiritual paths and characters, "Bull of Heaven" weaves Buczynski's life into a tapestry that encompasses the history of contemporary Paganism and the occult in New York City. And in so doing, it offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of GLBT men and women whose heretofore untold contributions helped to shape the face of contemporary Paganism. Part biography, part history, Bull of Heaven shines a spotlight on that rarest of beasts-a previously unstudied slice of New York City history.</p><p></p><h2>Thoreau Notebook: A blank journal Inspired by his life and writings</h2><p>Writer, naturalist, and iconoclastic thinker, Henry David Thoreau is treasured by writers, walkers, readers, environmentalists, and tax resisters.

The Society of Biblical Literature recently ended the work of a group devoted to the study of Paul&#39;s theology. We are now seeing the publication of a number of books from various points of view that are examining the life, thought, and influence of the apostle Paul. Despite this recent attention to Paul&#39;s thought, J. Louis Martyn believes that insufficient attention has been paid to the discovery of numerous and pervasive apocalyptic themes in Paul&#39;s letters. Further, says Martyn, Paul is still being studied somewhat in isolation, almost as though he had neither comrades nor competitors. One of the results is that Paul is sometimes credited with views he did not hold--views which were, in fact, held by his opponents. In Theological Issues in the Letters of Paul we find the results of a lifetime of study of Paul&#39;s letters by a well-known and widely respected New Testament scholar.</p><p>J.

Now it's seen as one of the rising stars of the global economy. Where does the truth lie? How did a land likened to paradise by the first conquistadores become a byword for hell on earth? And how is it rebuilding itself after decades of violence?

Exactly one week after watching the tape, four teenagers die one after another of heart failure. <br><br>Asakawa, a hardworking journalist, is intrigued by his niece's inexplicable death. His investigation leads him from a metropolitan tokyo teeming with modern society's fears to a rural Japan--a mountain resort, a volcanic island, and a countryside clinic--haunted by the past. His attempt to solve the tape's mystery before it's too late--for everyone--assumes an increasingly deadly urgency. Ring is a chillingly told horror story, a masterfully suspenseful mystery, and post-modern trip. <br><br>The success of Koji Suzuki's novel the Ring has lead to manga, television and film adaptations in Japan, Korea, and the U.S.</p><p>Koji Suzuki was born in 1957 in Hamamatsu, southwest of Tokyo. He attended Keio University where he majored in French. After graduating he held numerous odd jobs, including a stint as a cram school teacher. Also a self-described jock, he holds a first-class yachting license and crossed the U.S., from Key West to Los Angeles, on his motorcycle.The father of two daughters, Suzuki is a respected authority on childrearing and has written numerous works on the subject. He acquired his expertise when he was a struggling writer and househusband. Suzuki also has translated a children's book into Japanese, <i>The Little Sod Diaries</i> by the crime novelist Simon Brett.In 1990, Suzuki's first full-length work, <i>Paradise</i> won the Japanese Fantasy Novel Award and launched his career as a fiction writer. <i>Ring</i>, written with a baby on his lap, catapulted him to fame, and the multi-million selling sequels <i>Spiral </i>and<i> Loop</i> cemented his reputation as a world-class talent. Often called the "Stephen King of Japan," Suzuki has played a crucial role in establishing mainstream credentials for horror novels in his country. He is based in Tokyo but loves to travel, often in the United States. <i>Birthday</i> is his sixth novel to appear in English.The success of the 2002 American movie The Ring, a remake of Hideo Nakata's Ringu, has excited interest both in the original film and in the novel on which it's based. The plot will be familiar to the movie's many fans: a reporter, Asakawa, connects the death of his niece to the deaths of three other high school students. During his investigation, he discovers a videotape with a terrible warning: "Those who view these images are fated to die at this exact moment one week from now." With the aid of a friend, Asakawa traces the video to an alleged psychic and her daughter, Sadako. As in a classic ghost story, fate singles out one, often innocent character as a scapegoat. But the misogynistic society that persecutes Sadako and her mother must ultimately bear witness to its sin-or perish. Despite a somewhat pedestrian and unintentionally comic prose style that seems derived from manga comics ("Ryuji was right. Men could not bear children"), fans of the movie won't be disappointed. Anyone curious in how the Japanese see themselves will find this book a fascinating, and ultimately highly disturbing, experience.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Family on Beartown Road: A Memoir of Love and Courage</h2><p>A <i>New York Time</i>s Notable Book<br><b><br>The Family on Beartown Road</b> is Elizabeth Cohen&#x2019;s true and moving portrait of love and courage. <br><br>Elizabeth, a member of the &#x201c;sandwich generation&#x201d;&#x2014;those caught in the middle, simultaneously caring for their children and for their aging parents&#x2014;is the mother of baby Ava and the daughter of Daddy, and responsible for both.

Maybe I am imagining, but sometimes I swear I can feel it: I can feel her dreaming. The sensation upon my fingers is less than a vibration but more than stillness. A something-in-between-nothing-and-something, vague but true. I imagine I can feel my daughter&#x2019;s mind becoming.<br><br>Touching her head in this way comes naturally to me, an instinctual rather than a conscious act. I do it because I am afraid of our circumstances as winter approaches. And because I understand now how delicate a mind is, the many ways in which it can fail a person.<br><br>When I was a child, whenever I felt upset, overwhelmed, unsure of my actions or that my thoughts were racing too fast to catch them, I developed the habit of placing my hand on my forehead. It has a calming effect, as though in doing so I can actually slow my mind down, fully possess it, or redirect its course. Just as I touch my daughter&#x2019;s head, at times when I wake from a particularly vivid dream, I have found myself cupping my own forehead. My hand on my head seems to help me better recall my dreams, as if it is an umbilicus from the sleeping world to waking, a bridge.<br><br>Just when I feel my daughter&#x2019;s dreams begin to swirl inside my palms, she often twitches or smiles or mumbles things that are not quite words but that, judging from her expressions, are sometimes serious, sometimes amusing. That is my favorite thing&#x2014;when she laughs in her sleep. Never at any time&#x2014;not when I first held her, wet and new, not when I comforted her when she was teething, not even when I fed her by breast&#x2014;have I felt as close to my daughter as I do when I touch her dreams.<br><br>Down the hall from where we sleep lies my father. I know when he dreams, too, because in his sleep he shouts and whimpers, declares and rages. He begs for my mother. He pleads. He shakes the bed. His dreaming is very busy.<br><br>Yet listening to him I have this thought&#x2014;that if I were to place a hand upon his forehead I would not feel a thing. There would be no subtle almost-vibration, no activity within that brain that once graded reams of undergraduate term papers, lectured about abuses of migratory laborers, charted trends in factory employment and union membership. That mind that once won him a fellowship to Harvard to study industrial relations would be startlingly silent. I fear that touching the forehead of my father, a professor emeritus of economics, I would feel nothing. Rather than signs of a mind&#x2019;s activity, his dreams seem like echoes of a past intelligence. His voice in the night is a habit, a reflex. He calls out because he can. That is all.<br><br>The baby dreaming beside me is acquiring all the cognitive processes that will guide her in life. My father has Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease; time, place, people, and events all blur and dissemble for him. It has stolen almost all of his connections to life.<br><br>Just as I have considered the mechanics of dreaming, I have begun to think about thinking. Thinking about thought is a peculiar experience. When it is someone else&#x2019;s thought it is mostly conjecture, because no person is privy to that most private space of another. When it is my own thought it is confusing and sometimes scary. I can detect both the strengths and the flaws in my mind, its laziness and gaps and the great trough of forgetting that opens between certain events. And it occurs to me, when I sense this canyon of lost memories snaking through my life, that I hate forgetting. I hate it more than anything&#x2014;sorrow, indifference, hunger, cold. It takes and takes, a robber who absconds with ideas, names, dates, prized moments, song lyrics, stanzas of poetry, recipes, the punch lines of jokes. It steals what a person truly owns; it takes the life he has lived, leaving him stranded on the island of the present.<br><br>Forgetting is my only real enemy. And it is taking my father in fits and starts, in chunks and in slices, stretching out the pain of loss unbearably.<br><br>But forgetting lives in our house now like another person. It is always hungry. I go into my husband Shane&#x2019;s painting studio, where the canvases sing with color and seem so immune to erasure, and I wonder&#x2014;when will it encroach here? Someday will he forget the way cadmium meshes with black, the lovely moment of approaching a freshly gessoed canvas, the way he spits on his fingers and rubs the chalky color from pastels into a muted shadow on a face?<br><br>I watch myself forgetting to pick up toothpaste when I am shopping, forgetting to give my father his medication, forgetting the date, forgetting the capital of Tennessee. It is insidious.<br><br>My daughter does not yet know enough to forget. Each thing in her mind is a bright new resident, firmly affixed and special. She remembers where the cookies are, gets excited when I approach the jar. She points at a carton of chocolate milk on the left side of the refrigerator behind the juice. She is just beginning to approach speech; still, she communicates remembering very well. While we are surprised that she can remember so much, she is nonchalant. She has been alive under a year, yet she acts like she has always known these things. For Ava, remembering comes naturally, like a sneeze, a hiccup.<br><br>She is learning so fast now that I cannot keep up with all she knows. She is learning her body. Not with words, but locations. Say &#x201c;nose,&#x201d; and sometimes, I swear, she points at her nose. Say &#x201c;tongue&#x201d; and out hers pops. Did I teach her the location of her tongue? When did I do that? I rack my brain for a recollection of an instance of tongue instruction, but none comes to me. If I did, I have forgotten it. But she hasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>One recent night as I lay beside her, watching her laugh at some secret amusement as she slept, my father walked into the room. He saw me there, touching her head while her subconscious laughter pealed forth. I waited for him to comment, to say something about her laughter, about my hand on her laughter, about her beauty, there on the pillow, a mass of dark curls spread out around her face. Instead he seemed embarrassed, as though he had walked in on a private moment. As though her joyful sleep were something intimate he should not have seen.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I said, inviting him into her beauty. &#x201c;She laughs in her sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>He walked over and glanced down, looking at Ava laughing and sleeping.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, considering her, &#x201c;I was thinking about that same thing recently. That funny thing. But now it&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><h2>Life in the spirit in marriage, home &amp; work: An exposition of Ephesians 5:18 to 6:9</h2><p>An excellent guide for the solid application of the Bible to the perplexities of marriage and family living in our day for preachers, teachers, parents, and young people.</p><p>D.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the twentieth book in the series. &#39;If we had only two or three of Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s Aubrey-Maturin series, we would count ourselves lucky; with six or seven the author would be safely among the greats of historical fiction! This is great writing by an undiminished talent. Now on to Volume Twenty, and the liberation of Chile.&#39; WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, Literary Review This is the twentieth book in Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s highly acclaimed, bestselling series chronicling the adventures of lucky Jack Aubrey and his best friend Stephen Maturin, part ship&#39;s doctor, part secret agent. The novel&#39;s stirring action follows on from that of The Hundred Days. Napoleon&#39;s hundred days of freedom and his renewed threat to Europe have ended at Waterloo and Aubrey has finally, as the title suggests, become a blue level admiral. He and Maturin have -- at last -- set sail on their much postponed mission to Chile. Vivid with the salty tang of life at sea, O&#39;Brian&#39;s writing is as powerful as ever whether he writes of naval hierarchies, night-actions or the most celebrated fictional friendship since that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. Blue at the Mizzen also brings alive the sights and sounds of revolutionary South America in a story as exciting as any O&#39;Brian has written.</p><p>Almost three decades after commencing his maritime epic with <i>Master and Commander</i>, Patrick O'Brian is still at it. The 20th episode, <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>, is another swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, complete with romantic escapades from smoggy London to Sierra Leone, diplomacy, espionage, the intricacies of warfare, and imperial brinksmanship. As always, these events are bound up in the ongoing friendship between two officers of the Royal Navy. Jack Aubrey is the naval captain, bold yet compassionate, innovative yet cautious, as fearless in war as he is bumbling in affairs of the heart and household. His boon companion Stephen Maturin is the ship's surgeon--and additionally a spy for the British government, a wealthy Catalonian aristocrat, a doting Irish father, and an avid naturalist.<p> That may sound like a lot to keep track of. However, it's not necessary to carry around a scorecard or ship's roster while reading <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>. The ostensible issue is whether Jack will finally be promoted to Admiral of the Blue. But long before he hears any word from the Napoleonic era's equivalent of Personnel, he loses half his crew to desertion, his ship undergoes a disastrous collision, and the entire company comes close to perishing in the ice-choked seas off Cape Horn. Meanwhile, the widowed Maturin issues a surprising proposal of marriage to a beautiful, mud-bespattered fellow naturalist while trekking through an African mangrove swamp. (The two lovebirds happen to be searching for a rare variant of <i>Caprimulgus longipennis</i>, the long-tailed nightjar, which they hope to surprise in full mating plumage.)</p><p> Still, this is hardly a plot-driven novel. O'Brian takes time to get anywhere, and invariably enjoys the journey more than the arrival. So even as we get constant hints of the climax to come--Jack's spectacular naval action on behalf of the infant Republic of Chile--we don't mind hearing about the nuances of shipboard existence or the secret life of the white-faced tree duck. We're treated, for example, to this snippet about managed care, circa 1816: </p><blockquote> Poll, Maggie and a horse-leech from the starboard watch have been administering enemas to the many, many cases of gross surfeit that have now replaced the frostbites, torsions, and debility of the recent past, the very recent past. Strong, fresh, seal-meat has not its equal for upsetting the seaman's metabolism: he is much better kept on biscuits, Essex cheese, and a very little well-seethed salt pork--kept on short commons. </blockquote> And we're grateful! We can only hope that the elderly author will favor us with at least one more novel, so that his avid followers can avoid their own form of short commons. Life without Aubrey and Maturin would be a deprivation indeed. <i>--Andrew Himes</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda&#39;s Newest Center of Operations in Southeast Asia</h2><p>For anyone wishing to understand the next, post-9/11 generation of al-Qaeda planning, leadership, and tactics, there is only one place to begin: Southeast Asia. In fact, such countries as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia have been crucial nodes in the al-Qaeda network since long before the strikes on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, but when the allies overran Afghanistan, the new camps in Southeast Asia became the key training grounds for the future. It is in the Muslim strongholds in the Philippines and Indonesia that the next generation of al-Qaeda can be found. In this powerful, eye-opening work, Maria Ressa casts the most illuminating light ever on this fascinating but little-known "terrorist HQ."<p>Every major al-Qaeda attack since 1993 has had a connection to the Philippines, and Maria Ressa, CNN's lead investigative reporter for Asia and a Filipino-American who has lived in the region since 1986, has broken story after story about them. From the early, failed attempts to assassinate Pope John Paul II and Bill Clinton to the planning of the 9/11 strikes and the "48 Hours of Terror," in which eleven American jetliners were to be blown up over the Pacific, she has interviewed the terrorists, their neighbors and families, and the investigators from six different countries who have tracked them down. After the Bali bombing, al-Qaeda's worst strike since 9/11, which killed more than two hundred, Ressa broke major revelations about how it was planned, why it was a Plan B substitute for an even more ambitious scheme aimed at Singapore, and why the suicide bomber recruited to deliver the explosives almost caused the whole plan to fall apart when he admitted he could barely drive a car.</p><p>Above all, Ressa has seen how al-Qaeda's tactics are shifting under the pressures of the war on terror. Rather than depending upon its own core membership (estimated at three to four thousand at its peak), the network is now enmeshing itself in local conflicts, co-opting Muslim independence movements wherever they can be found, and helping local "revolutionaries" to fund, plan, and execute sinister attacks against their neighbors and the West.</p><p> If history is any guide, al-Qaeda revisits its plans over and over until they can succeed -- and many of those plans have already been discovered and are here revealed, thanks to classified investigative documents uncovered by Ressa.</p></p><p>While the Middle East receives much scrutiny as the home of extremist Muslim terrorists, Maria Ressa offers a closer look at Southeast Asia as a hotspot where Al-Qaeda forces and other organizations are continually growing larger and more powerful. Ressa, the CNN bureau chief in Jakarta, has been based in the region for most of her career and provides a highly unsettling inside perspective to the people and events of that region. Islamist terrorist networks are, by nature, shadowy and complex, especially to Westerners who might have difficulty understanding the cultures from which they spring, but Ressa adroitly explains the various people and factions in ways that are highly compelling and deeply disturbing. Although Osama bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and other Middle Eastern Al-Qaeda figures are featured here, Ressa also recalls personal interviews she conducted with Abu Bakar Ba'Asyir, the so-called "Asian Osama bin Laden," who denies any connection with terrorist organizations and acts despite voluminous evidence to the contrary. And personal experiences such as that are what make <i>Seeds of Terror</i> such an engrossing work of non-fiction. Tensions are consistently high in the region, especially for a western woman trying to learn the truth about what various groups are up to, and one comes to admire Ressa's persistence in trying to get the story even while repeatedly putting herself in mortal danger. Highlights included an explanation of how a failed Al-Qaeda plot in Singapore gave way to a successful attack in Bali, the career trajectory of an Al-Qaeda operative whose training begins in adolescence, and a look at the very real threat of ninja attacks. There are numerous books that provide investigations of terrorist networks but Ressa's unique point of view combined with how relatively under-publicized the Southeast Asian terrorist threat has been make this a must-read for anyone trying to understand how terrorism grows and spreads. --<i>John Moe</i><b>Maria A. Ressa</b>, CNN's lead investigative reporter in Asia, has lived and worked in Southeast Asia for more than sixteen years. In 1988, she was named CNN's Manila bureau chief and, in 1995, became CNN's Jakarta bureau chief. In addition, Ressa has traveled extensively and reported from India, Kashmir, China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States. Videotapes of her coverage of terrorism were found in what experts believe to be Osama bin Laden's private videotape collection in Afghanistan. <p> Ressa graduated from Princeton University. She was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to the Philippines in 1986, where she attended graduate school at the University of the Philippines. Among the awards she has received are the Asian Television Award in 1999 for Indonesia, the SAIS-Novartis International Journalism Award in 2000 for her work in East Timor, the Ferris Professorship of Journalism in 2001, and the National Headliner Award for Investigative Journalism in 2002.</p></p><h2>Cassidy (Big Sky Dreams, Book 1)</h2><p><p>Following the success of her recent stand&#x2013;alone novel, <i>White Chocolate Moments,</i> bestselling author Lori Wick returns to delight readers with a new series set in the vast open places of Montana.</p> <p><i>Token Creek, Montana Territory, </i>1880&#x2014;Cassidy Norton is a fine seamstress who makes her living sewing for others. Amid the bustle of a busy frontier town, her life is rich. What time her business doesn&#x2019;t take, her friends and church family fill. But Cassidy hasn&#x2019;t always lived in Token Creek, and few people know her full story. So she struggles with a nagging unsettledness in her heart.</p> <p>Cassidy&#x2019;s friend Meg is married to a rancher and has a baby, something Cassidy wants for herself. But that would mean revealing the details of her life. Will Cassidy find the strength to take that risk?</p> <p>Book 1 in the Big Sky Dreams series.</p></p><p>Jill Shellabarger&#39;s lightly accented enunciation gives an authentic sound to the 1880s frontier town of Token Creek, Montana. Her youthful portrayal of Cassidy Norton, the town&#39;s young seamstress and shop owner, is understated. With empathy she captures Cassidy&#39;s yearning for a loving husband and tiny baby, just like her friend Meg has. As good as Shellabarger is, she can&#39;t make up for the boring plot and one-dimensional characters in this first installment of Wick&#39;s new Big Sky Dream series. Listeners expect a romantic plot with engaging characters. Instead, the romance falls flat, and listeners sit through six boring sermons instead of valuable scripture and spiritual guidance woven into the story. Wick fans will be disappointed in this one.

Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.<p> Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.</i></p><p> </p><p> Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. <i>--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca</i></p>"Mark Haddon's portrayal of an emotionally dissociated mind is a superb achievement. He is a wise and bleakly funny writer with rare gifts of empathy.&#x201d;<br>-Ian McEwan, author of ATONEMENT and AMSTERDAM<br><br>"I have never read anything quite like Mark Haddon's funny and agonizingly honest book, or encountered a narrator more vivid and memorable.

In South Boston that means a cold hard rain that ruins any memories of the sun. Doesn&#x2019;t matter, because I&#x2019;m in my office, wearing a twentyyear-old thrift-store wool suit. It&#x2019;s brown but not in the brown-is-the-new-black way. My shoes are Doc Martens, black like my socks. I&#x2019;m not neat and clean or shaved. I am sober but don&#x2019;t feel sober.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a woman sitting on the opposite side of my desk. I don&#x2019;t remember her coming in, but I know who she is: Jennifer Times, a flavor-of-the-second local celebrity, singing contestant on <i>American Star</i>, daughter of the Suffolk County DA, and she might be older than my suit. Pretty and brunette, lips that are worked out, pumped up. She&#x2019;s tall and her legs go from the north of Maine all the way down to Boston, but she sits like she&#x2019;s small, all compact, a closed book. She wears a white T-shirt and a knee-length skirt. She looks too spring for March, not that I care.</p><p>I wear a fedora, trying too hard to be anachronistic or iconoclastic, not sure which. It&#x2019;s dark in my office. The door is closed, the blinds drawn over the bay window. Someone should turn on a light.</p><p>I say, &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be in Hollywood? Not that I watch, but the little birdies tell me you&#x2019;re a finalist, and the live competition starts tomorrow night.&#x201d;</p><p>She says, &#x201c;They sent me home to do a promotional shoot at a mall and at my old high school.&#x201d; I like that she talks about her high school as if it were eons removed, instead of mere months.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky you.&#x201d;</p><p>She doesn&#x2019;t smile. Everything is serious. She says, &#x201c;I need your help, Mr. Genevich,&#x201d; and she pulls her white-gloved hands out of her lap.</p><p>I say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t trust hands that wear gloves.&#x201d;</p><p>She looks at me like I chose the worst possible words, like I missed the whole point of her story, the story I haven&#x2019;t heard yet. She takes off her right glove and her fingers are individually wrapped in bandages, but it&#x2019;s a bad wrap job, gauze coming undone and sticking out, Christmas presents wrapped in old tissue paper.</p><p>She says, &#x201c;I need you to find out who has my fingers.&#x201d;</p><p>I think about opening the shades; maybe some light wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad. I think about clearing my desk of empty soda cans. I think about canceling the Southie lease, too many people double-parking in front of my office/apartment building. I think about the ever-expanding doomed universe. And all of it makes more sense than what she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Say that again.&#x201d;</p><p>Her blue eyes stay fixed on me, like she&#x2019;s the one trying to figure out who is telling the truth. She says, &#x201c;I woke up like this yesterday. Someone stole my fingers and replaced them with these.&#x201d; She holds her hand out to me as if I can take it away from her and inspect it.</p><p>&#x201c;May I?&#x201d; I gently take her hand, and I lift up the bandage on her index finger and find a ring of angry red stitches. She takes her hand back from me quick, like if I hold on to it too long I might decide to keep those replacement digits of hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Ms. Times, circumstantial evidence to the contrary and all that, but I don&#x2019;t think what you described is exactly possible.&#x201d; I point at her hand. I&#x2019;m telling her that her hand is impossible. &#x201c;Granted, my subscription to <i>Mad Scientist Weekly</i> did run out. Too many words, not enough pictures.&#x201d;</p><p>She says, &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you think is possible, Mr. Genevich, because I&#x2019;ll only be paying you to find answers to my questions.&#x201d; Her voice is hard as pavement. I get the sense that she isn&#x2019;t used to people telling her no.</p><p>I gather the loose papers on my desk, stack them, and then push them over the edge and into the trash can. I want a cigarette but I don&#x2019;t know where I put my pack. &#x201c;How and why did you find me?&#x201d; I talk slow. Every letter and syllable has to be in its place.</p><p>&#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d; She talks quick and to the point. She wants to tell me more, tell me everything about every thing, but she&#x2019;s holding something back. Or maybe she&#x2019;s just impatient with me, like everyone else.</p><p>I say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t do much fieldwork anymore, Ms. Times. Early retirement, so early it happened almost before I got the job. See this computer?&#x201d; I turn the flat-screen monitor toward her. An infinite network of Escheresque pipes fills the screen-saver pixels. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I do. I research. I do genealogies, find abandoned properties, check the status of out-of-state warrants, and find lost addresses. I search databases and, when desperate, which is all the time, I troll Craigslist and eBay and want ads. I&#x2019;m no action hero. I find stuff in the Internet ether. Something tells me your fingers won&#x2019;t be in there.&#x201d;</p><p>She says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you ten thousand just for trying.&#x201d; She places a check on my desk. I assume it&#x2019;s a check. It&#x2019;s green and rectangular.</p><p>&#x201c;What, no manila envelope bulging with unmarked bills?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you another fifty thousand if you find out who has my fingers.&#x201d;</p><p>I am about to say something sharp and clever about her allowance from Daddy, but I blink my eyes and she is gone.</p><b>Two</b> <p></p><p>Right after I come to is always the worst, when the questions about dreams and reality seem fair game, when I don&#x2019;t know which is which. Jennifer Times is gone and my head is full of murk. I try to push the murk to the corners of my consciousness, but it squeezes out and leaks away, mercury in a closed fist. That murk, it&#x2019;s always there. It&#x2019;s both a threat and a promise. I am narcoleptic.</p><p>How long was I asleep? My office is dark, but it&#x2019;s always dark. I have the sense that a lot of time has passed. Or maybe just a little. I have no way of knowing. I generally don&#x2019;t remember to check and set my watch as I&#x2019;m passing out. Time can&#x2019;t be measured anyway, only guessed at, and my guesses are usually wrong, which doesn&#x2019;t speak well for a guy in my line of work. But I get by.</p><p>I paw around my desk and find a pack of cigarettes behind the phone, right where I left them. I light one. It&#x2019;s warm, white, and lethal. I&#x2019;d like to say that smoking keeps me awake, clears the head, all that good stuff normally associated with nicotine and carcinogens, but it doesn&#x2019;t. Smoking is just something I do to help pass the time in the dark, between sleeps.</p><p>On my desk there is no green and rectangular ten-thousand dollar check. Too bad, I&#x2019;d quickly grown fond of the little fella. There is a manila envelope, and on my notepad are gouges and scratches in ink, an EKG output of a faulty heart. My notepad is yellow like the warning traffic light.</p><p>I lean back in my chair, looking for a new vantage point, a different way to see. My chair complains. The squawking springs tease me and my sedentary existence. No one likes a wiseass. It might be time for a new chair.</p><p>Okay, Jennifer Times. I conclude the stuff about her missing fingers was part of a hypnogogic hallucination, which is one of the many pithy symptoms of narcolepsy. It&#x2019;s a vivid dream that occurs when my narcoleptic brain is partially awake, or partially asleep, as if there is a difference.</p><p>I pick up the manila envelope and remove its contents: two black-and-white photos, with accompanying negatives.</p><p>Photo 1: Jennifer Times sitting on a bed. Shoulder-length hair obscures most of her face. There&#x2019;s a close-lipped smile that peeks through, and it&#x2019;s wary of the camera and, by proxy, me. She&#x2019;s wearing a white T-shirt and a dark-colored pleated skirt. It&#x2019;s hiked above her knees. Her knees have scabs and bruises. Her arms are long and closed in tight, like a mantis.</p><p>Photo 2: Jennifer Times sitting on a bed. She&#x2019;s topless and wearing only white panties. She sits on her folded legs, feet under her buttocks, hands resting on her thighs. Her skin is bleached white, and she is folded. Origami. Arms are at her side and they push her small breasts together. Her eyes are closed and head tilted back. A light fixture shines directly above her head, washing her face in white light. Ligature in her neck is visible, as are more than a few ribs. The smile from the first photo has become something else, a grimace maybe.</p><p>The photos are curled, a bit washed and faded. They feel old and heavy with passed time. They&#x2019;re imperfect. These photos are like my memories.</p><p>I put the photos side by side on my desktop. On the lip of the Coke-can ashtray my cigarette is all ash, burnt down to the filter. I just lit it, but that&#x2019;s how time works for me. My constant enemy, it attacks whenever I&#x2019;m not looking.</p><p>All right. Focus. It&#x2019;s a simple blackmail case. Some entrepreneur wants Jennifer to invest in his private cause or these photos go public and then she gets the gong, the hook, voted off the island on <i>American Star</i>.</p><p>But why would a blackmailer send the negatives? The photos have likely been digitized and reside on a hard drive or two somewhere. Still, her&#x2014;and now me&#x2014;being in possession of the negatives is troubling. There&#x2019;s more here, and less, of course, since I don&#x2019;t remember any of our conversation besides the finger stuff, so I light another cigarette.</p><p>The Jennifer in the photos doesn&#x2019;t look exactly like the Jennifer I&#x2019;ve seen on TV or the one who visited my office. The difference is hard to describe, but it&#x2019;s there, like the difference in taste between butter and margarine. I look at the photos again. It could be her; the Jennifer from a few years ago, from high school, the Jennifer from before professional makeup teams and personal stylists. Or maybe the photo Jennifer is margarine instead of butter.</p></p><h2>The Double Game</h2><p><p>A few years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, spook-turned-novelist Edwin Lemaster revealed to up-and-coming journalist Bill Cage that he&#x2019;d once considered spying for the enemy. For Cage, a Foreign Service brat who grew up in the very cities where Lemaster&#x2019;s books were set, the news story created a brief but embarrassing sensation and heralded the beginning of the end of his career in journalism.<br> <br> More than two decades later, Cage, now a lonely, disillusioned PR man, receives an anonymous note hinting that he should have dug deeper into Lemaster&#x2019;s pronouncement. Spiked with cryptic references to some of Cage&#x2019;s favorite spy novels, the note is the first of many literary bread crumbs that lead him back to Vienna, Prague, and Budapest, each instruction drawing him closer to the complex truth, each giving rise to more questions: Why is beautiful Litzi Strauss back in his life after thirty years? How much of his father&#x2019;s job involved the CIA? As the events of Lemaster&#x2019;s past eerily&#x2014;and dangerously&#x2014;begin intersecting with those of Cage&#x2019;s own, a &#x201c;long stalemate of secrecy&#x201d; may finally be coming to an end. <br> <br> A story about spies and their secrets, fathers and sons, lovers and fate, duplicity and loyalty, <i>The Double Game</i> ingeniously taps the espionage classics of the Cold War to build a spellbinding maze of intrigue. It is Dan Fesperman&#x2019;s most audacious, suspenseful, and satisfying novel yet.<br></p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2012</strong>: <i>The Double Game</i> begins as a playful spy caper within a spy caper, in which clues to a mystery are found in the pages and plots of old spy novels. Okay, clever enough. But the story quickly becomes more refreshingly and unexpectedly mysterious with each turn of the page, and I realized that Fesperman has achieved something remarkable here. He&#x2019;s turned the spy novel on its head, while paying homage to the genre, and at the same time giving us an unlikely protagonist who discovers that he&#x2019;s lived his entire life in a world &#x201c;where fact and fiction were virtually indistinguishable.&#x201d; Innovative and evocative. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>Dan Fesperman&#x2019;s travels as a writer have taken him to thirty countries and three war zones. <i>Lie in the Dark </i>won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association of Britain&#x2019;s John Creasey Memorial Dagger Award for best first crime novel, <i>The Small Boat of Great Sorrows</i> won their Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller, and <i>The Prisoner of Guantï¿½namo </i>won the Dashiell Hammett Award from the International Association of Crime Writers.

Each emotionally involving story illuminates a different kind of love: star-crossed, intense, needy, eternal, unrequited, even comical. Wilder&#x2019;s protagonists will be instantly recognizable to his fans: men and women who stumble into relationships that can fulfill them or knock them out cold. Which one it will be depends, often, on the smallest of gestures or reactions. Wilder&#x2019;s stories include: <p></p>ï¿½ &#x201c;In Love for the First Time,&#x201d; about a lover so shy and studious that he&#x2019;s a &#x201c;funny duck&#x201d; who has to be led by the hand by his equally inexperienced girlfriend <p></p>ï¿½ &#x201c;About Being in Love,&#x201d; featuring coarse but charming Buddy Silverman, who yearns for connection but looks for it in exactly the wrong kind of woman <p></p>ï¿½ &#x201c;The Woman in the Red Hat,&#x201d; who shows a writer who has only explored love in his books what the real thing feels like. <p></p></p><p><p>Gene Wilder has been acting since he was thirteen and writing for the screen since the early 1970s.&nbsp; His first book, about his own life, was <i>Kiss Me Like A Stranger</i>. His first novel, set in France in World War I, is <i>My French Whore</i>.&nbsp; He lives in Connecticut with his wife, Karen.</p>The Birthday<br>Rumor has it that Buddy Silberman drove up to Caesars Palace one afternoon with his best friend, Sonny Hurwitz, and was seen at the craps tables that evening, where Buddy was overheard making a bet with Sonny that he was either going to make forty thousand &#x201c;smackers&#x201d; that night or walk out of the hotel naked.<br>It was cold and raining at four in the morning when Buddy walked out of Caesars Palace, stark naked except for the L.A. Times wrapped around his waist.<br>As he hurried into Sonny&#x2019;s car, the night doorman heard Sonny call out, &#x201c;You jerk&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t have held you to your bet.&#x201d;<br>Buddy answered, &#x201c;A bet is a bet&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not a welcher&#x2014;now get me the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br>Sonny and Buddy lived and worked in Los Angeles selling wireless cable television. While they were having lunch at Junior&#x2019;s delicatessen, their usual eatery, Sonny decided to take the bull by the horns.<br>&#x201c;I wanna ask you something seriously, Buddy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; Buddy said.<br>&#x201c;Have you ever been in love?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course! All the time,&#x201d; Buddy answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d go crazy if I wasn&#x2019;t in love once in a while.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You really mean it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure. When we were growing up, did you ever see a train standing in Milwaukee station, waiting to get started?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah . . .&#x201d; Sonny answered, not having a clue where Buddy&#x2019;s mind was headed.<br>&#x201c;Then all of a sudden you hear a big blast and the engine shoots out this gigantic gust of steam, maybe twenty, thirty feet in the air, like an explosion?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about, Sonny.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What the hell have choo-choo trains got to do with being in love?&#x201d; Sonny asked, almost choking on his corned beef sandwich.<br>&#x201c;YOU&#x2019;VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE POISONS, SONNY! You can&#x2019;t let them sit inside your nuts and wait for them to explode. You gotta release all that stuff or you&#x2019;ll go nuts. Didn&#x2019;t you ever study mental health in high school?&#x201d;<br>Sonny took a long pause before answering. Buddy&#x2019;s weird meta phors always drove him crazy.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about sex, Buddy. I&#x2019;m talking about love.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Same difference.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Buddy . . . when you invite a young lady to your boudoir, how much time do you actually spend with her?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Into my WHAT?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your bedroom! Didn&#x2019;t you learn any French when you were taking all those mental health classes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure! Voo lay voo voo coo shay avec moi? They understand that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who understands that?&#x201d; Sonny asked, getting more and more annoyed.<br>&#x201c;French broads.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you insult women by calling them broads?&#x201d; Sonny asked.<br>&#x201c;Because Sinatra does,&#x201d; Buddy answered.<br>Sonny took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. &#x201c;And supposing she&#x2019;s not French?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I say it anyway&#x2014;makes a good impression. You wanna go to Mateo&#x2019;s for dinner tonight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not tonight, Buddy. I&#x2019;ve got a date with a very nice woman. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>Buddy went to dinner alone at Mateo&#x2019;s, where there was a movie star eating in the booth next to him almost every time he went. When he got home he found a note under his door.<br>Buddy. I&#x2019;m free tonight. If you want me to come over, call me.<br>xoxo Carol What&#x2019;s Her Name<br>Buddy had to look up her telephone number under W, for &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Her Name,&#x201d; because he had a terrible memory when it came to last names.<br>Carol What&#x2019;s Her Name came to Buddy&#x2019;s apartment at 10:30 p.m., as Buddy had requested. When she came in they greeted each other like old pals.<br>&#x201c;How ya doin&#x2019;?&#x201d; she asked, as she gave him a nice little hug and took off her jacket.<br>&#x201c;Doing good,&#x201d; Buddy answered. &#x201c;You want something to drink?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure! What have you got?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I got a half bottle of Chianti, but I opened it three days ago. It&#x2019;s probably still good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any whiskey, do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry. I got whatcha callit&#x2014;<br>Crï¿½me de something&#x2014;if you want?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no, that&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You wanna start?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br>They went into Buddy&#x2019;s bedroom. The TV was on, of course . . . some movie in black and white, with Fred Mac-Murray.<br>Carol What&#x2019;s Her Name began undressing.<br>&#x201c;You want me to undress you, Buddy? You like that sometimes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s all right. I&#x2019;m hot to trot.&#x201d;<br>Ten minutes later, just when Fred MacMurray was running away from Marjorie Maine, Buddy got out of bed, gave Carol What&#x2019;s Her Name fifty dollars, and said, &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Anytime, Buddy,&#x201d; she said as she put on her jacket. &#x201c;And one day you&#x2019;re gonna remember my last name.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What was it again?&#x201d; Buddy asked.<br>&#x201c;Berger. BERGER! Just think of hamburgers and you can&#x2019;t go wrong. Are you going to walk me to the door?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>They walked through the living room and Buddy opened the door for her. She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and left.<br>Buddy went back to his bedroom to watch the end of the movie, which he had never turned off. When it was over, he took out the Sharp pocket telephone directory from his end table drawer, deleted &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Her Name,&#x201d; and, under K, he wrote &#x201c;Ketchup.&#x201d;<br>A week later, on Buddy&#x2019;s forty-eighth birthday, Sonny treated him to the Japanese restaurant that everyone was raving about, Kamegashi Sushi.<br>It was jam-packed, but Sonny had made a big fuss on the phone a week earlier when he&#x2019;d made the reservation. He said he had to have a nice table because his friend just got out of the hospital and it was his birthday and Kamegashi Sushi was his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. He also told the lady on the phone that Buddy was a big Hollywood producer. It worked.<br>An attractive Japanese woman&#x2014;thin as a needle, with shiny black hair and wearing a very attractive black dress&#x2014;greeted them at the door. Sonny recognized her voice from the telephone and figured that she must be the maï¿½tre d&#x2019;.<br>&#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Sonny Hurwitz,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;I believe we spoke to each other on the phone last week. Thanks so much for the reservation. May I present Mr. Buddy Silberman, the Hollywood producer I told you about. He just got out of the hospital yesterday.&#x201d;<br>The woman introduced herself as Kayoko. She gently took Buddy&#x2019;s arm and walked him past the long sushi bar. All the sushi chefs yelled &#x201c;Hai!&#x201d; and nodded their heads as Buddy and Sonny passed by. Kayoko led them to a semiprivate table in the corner. Buddy couldn&#x2019;t figure out why they were getting special treatment. Sonny hadn&#x2019;t told him about the producer business, but Buddy wasn&#x2019;t complaining. He also took a fancy to this young lady, who seemed genuinely concerned about making him comfortable.<br>When they were seated, Kayoko said, &#x201c;Would you like me to bring you lovely things to eat . . . some of our specialties . . . if you trust me?&#x201d;<br>Buddy burst out with, &#x201c;I trust ya, honey! Sorry&#x2014;what&#x2019;s your name again?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kayoko . . . Can you say?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course I can say &#x2018;Kay-O-Ko!&#x2019; Hey, look at that&#x2014;I can speak Japanese.&#x201d; Kayoko laughed.<br>&#x201c;All right now, can you say &#x2018;Buddy&#x2019;?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Bud-dy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Oh, look&#x2014;I speak English.&#x201d; And they all laughed again.<br>&#x201c;Would the gentlemen like some hot sake?&#x201d; Kayoko asked.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about the gentlemen, but we certainly would,&#x201d; Buddy answered, and cracked up over his silly joke.<br>Kayoko made a tiny bow and left. Buddy watched her as she walked away.<br>&#x201c;My kinda woman,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Sonny asked.<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s short. She&#x2019;s got a sense of humor. And she smells good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You should ask her to marry you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe I will. First we gotta see how good the food is.&#x201d; A waiter came to their table, holding a tray with two small jars of sake and two little cups. He placed them on the table.<br>&#x201c;Hot sake,&#x201d; he said as he poured a little in their cups, then gave a polite bow and left.<br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, kid,&#x201d; Sonny said as he raised his cup.<br>&#x201c;God bless you.&#x201d;<br>They clicked their sake cups and took a sip.<br>&#x201c;Yum!&#x201d; Sonny said. &#x201c;This is the best sake I&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She sure is,&#x201d; Buddy said as he turned to look for Kayoko.<br>A few minutes later, Kayoko walked in with a tray of things that smelled sensational.<br>&#x201c;Whoa! Whatcha got there, Kayoko?&#x201d; Buddy asked, as if he was about to burst into song.<br>Kayoko leaned over Buddy&#x2019;s shoulder. While she was close to his cheek, she said softly: &#x201c;Buddy, I bring you and your good friend some sashimi salad and meguro tuna hand rolls with Japanese mayo and blanched asparagus . . . and a few soft-shell crab hand rolls, warm and very special.&#x201d;<br>She artistically poured each of them a little more sake in their tiny cups. &#x201c;I hope you enjoy,&#x201d; she said, made a little bow, and left.<br>&#x201c;Oy yoi yoi! I could get used to this, Sonny.&#x201d;<br>After their delicious appetizers, they had tiger shrimp in a special sauce and black cod in miso sauce. They were both stuffed, but Kayoko walked in carrying a tiny sponge cake with one lit candle.<br>&#x201c;Happy birthday to you, Buddy.&#x201d;<br>Before Buddy could blow out the candle, Sonny jumped up and said, &#x201c;Wait&#x2014;let me take a picture! Kayoko, you get in there, too.&#x201d;<br>He had his little Minolta all ready. Kayoko leaned down and rested her cheek on Buddy&#x2019;s cheek.<br>&#x201c;Say &#x2018;cheese&#x2019; or &#x2018;yummy&#x2019; or something,&#x201d; Sonny said just before he took the photo.<br>&#x201c;One for protection,&#x201d; Buddy said before Kayoko could remove her cheek. He didn&#x2019;t care about the picture; he wanted her cheek against his for a few more seconds.<br>&#x201c;Great! Got it,&#x201d; Sonny said.<br>Kayoko got up and took Sonny&#x2019;s camera.<br>&#x201c;Now you two together and I take picture.&#x201d;<br>Sonny kneeled down next to Buddy and imitated Kayoko, rubbing his cheek against Buddy&#x2019;s.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Kayoko shouted. &#x201c;Good picture. Two nice friends.&#x201d; On their way out of the restaurant, Kayoko walked them to the sidewalk.<br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, Buddy-san. Good life for you, always,&#x201d; and she gave him a little kiss on the cheek.<br>&#x201c;Good night, Sonny-san,&#x201d; she said.<br>Kayoko bowed and went back into the restaurant.<br>&#x201c;You know what I like about Japanese girls?&#x201d; Buddy asked as they walked to Sonny&#x2019;s car.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t look at how short a guy is or that I got eczema on my face.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You think all Japanese girls do that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Buddy said with authority.<br>&#x201c;How many have you met?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two, but this one&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And what if you run out of Japanese girls?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I go to nice &#x2018;fifty dollars a throw&#x2019; girls. They don&#x2019;t mind, either, if I&#x2019;m short and have eczema.&#x201d;<br>Sonny was out of town for three weeks on business. As soon as the plane landed he called Buddy.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m back! Where do you want to go for dinner tonight? WAIT! I know the answer: Kamegashi Sushi, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nah, I&#x2019;m tired of Japanese food,&#x201d; Buddy said.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to see Kayoko?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nah, she&#x2019;s a little bit of a drag.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you talking about? You wanted to marry her last week.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell ya later. I feel like a steak tonight.&#x201d;<br>That night they went to the Palms restaurant. Buddy ordered a twenty-two-ounce porter house steak for two, for himself. Buddy wasn&#x2019;t much of a drinker, but after a shot of Absolut with his shrimp cocktail he had a glass of Merlot with his steak and fries.<br>&#x201c;Tell me about Kayoko,&#x201d; Sonny said.<br>&#x201c;I went to her restaurant a couple times while you were gone. She was sweet and nice like always, and all of a sudden she wants to get married. She scared me to death. I mean, she&#x2019;s a nice girl and I liked her and all . . . but, Jesus! Marriage?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Were you two ever&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I kissed her once, on the cheek, when I was leaving the restaurant. After that she drove me crazy with the marriage business and &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s get married,&#x2019; and &#x2018;I take good care of you.&#x2019; I mean&#x2014;Jesus, these Japanese girls.&#x201d;<br>A few months later, Buddy was in Las Vegas for business, not gambling. Sonny was alone one night and felt like eating Japanese food and drinking some hot sake, but he didn&#x2019;t want to run into Kayoko at Kamegashi Sushi, so he went to a new place he&#x2019;d heard about, Kotobuki, in Venice. Not in Italy, of course, just near the ocean in L.A.<br>He walked in, and there to greet him was Kayoko. Talk about coincidence, he thought. She was polite and friendly, as always, and led him to a small table in the corner. She brought him some hot sake and poured a small cup for herself, too. They toasted each other with &#x201c;Kampai.&#x201d; As she was about to leave, Sonny said, &#x201c;Wait! Kayoko, forgive me&#x2014;would you please tell me what happened with you and Buddy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, it was very sad. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell me about it, please. I think you broke his heart, Kayoko. But maybe he broke your heart, I don&#x2019;t know. I just want to find out what really happened.&#x201d;<br>Kayoko looked at the floor for several seconds. &#x201c;I like Buddy. He is a nice man. But when he wanted to get married after we met only two times&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait a minute. Are you saying he was the one who wanted to get married?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t marry him. I don&#x2019;t love Buddy. I don&#x2019;t even know Buddy. He came to Kamegashi Sushi almost every night and would say he wanted to marry me . . . first, like a little joke, but then serious. Very serious. And he would beg me to &#x2018;Just give it a try, honey.&#x2019; I had to leave my job because I was so sad for him and afraid that he would keep coming to the restaurant.&#x201d;<br>Sonny was flabbergasted. He said a few nice things to Kayoko and told her it wasn&#x2019;t her fault at all, and that Buddy was a crazy guy. He wished her a happy life. She said, &#x201c;Thank you, Sonny-san.&#x201d;<br>Sonny went to Buddy&#x2019;s apartment a week later. He and Buddy played poker with a few friends once a week at each other&#x2019;s home or apartment. It was Buddy&#x2019;s turn. Sonny didn&#x2019;t have the guts to talk to him about Kayoko, but he was sure that she had told him the truth.<br>In the middle of the poker game they all took a coffee and cake break. Sonny had to use the toilet, but one of the guys was in the guest bathroom, so he asked Buddy if it would be all right to use the one off his bedroom. Buddy said, &#x201c;Sure!&#x201d;<br>Buddy&#x2019;s TV was on, of course, and his bed wasn&#x2019;t made up because the maid only came in once a week.<br>Just before going into the bathroom, Sonny saw the photo he had taken of Kayoko and Buddy on his birthday. Kayoko was smiling as she leaned against Buddy&#x2019;s cheek. Buddy had put the photo into a beautiful silver frame and placed it on the night table, next to his bed. Sonny had never seen him looking so happy.<br>Excerpted from What is This Thing Called Love? by .<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2010 by Gene Wilder.<br>Published in March 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Mommy&#x2019;s asleep or she&#x2019;s sick again.<br> &nbsp;<br> I hide and curl up small under the table in the kitchen. Through my fingers I can see Mommy. She is asleep on the couch. Her hand is on the sticky green rug, and he&#x2019;s wearing his big boots with the shiny buckle and standing over Mommy shouting.<br> &nbsp;<br> He hits Mommy with a belt. <i>Get up! Get up! You are one fucked-up bitch. You are one fucked-up bitch. You are one fucked-up bitch. You are one fucked-up bitch. You are one fucked-up bitch. You are one fucked-up bitch.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Mommy makes a sobbing noise. <i>Stop. Please stop.</i> Mommy doesn&#x2019;t scream. Mommy curls up small.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have my fingers in my ears, and I close my eyes. The sound stops.<br> &nbsp;<br> He turns and I can see his boots as he stomps into the kitchen. He still has the belt. He is trying to find me.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stoops down and grins. He smells nasty. Of cigarettes and drink. <i>There you are, you little shit.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A chilling wail wakes him. <i>Christ!</i> He&#x2019;s drenched in sweat and his heart is pounding. <i>What the fuck?</i> He sits bolt upright in bed and puts his head in hands. <i>Fuck. They&#x2019;re back. The noise was me.</i> He takes a deep steadying breath, trying to rid his mind and nostrils of the smell of cheap bourbon and stale Camel cigarettes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> I have survived Day Three Post-Christian, and my first day at work. It has been a welcome distraction. The time has flown by in a haze of new faces, work to do, and Mr. Jack Hyde. Mr. Jack Hyde . . . he smiles down at me, his blue eyes twinkling, as he leans against my desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Excellent work, Ana. I think we&#x2019;re going to make a great<br> team.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow, I manage to curl my lips upward in a semblance of a smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be off, if that&#x2019;s okay with you,&#x201d; I murmur.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, it&#x2019;s five thirty. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good night, Jack.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good night, Ana.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Collecting my bag, I shrug on my jacket and head for the door.<br> Out in the early evening air of Seattle, I take a deep breath. It doesn&#x2019;t begin to fill the void in my chest, a void that&#x2019;s been present since Saturday morning, a painful hollow reminder of my loss. I walk toward the bus stop with my head down, staring at my feet and contemplating being without my beloved Wanda, my old Beetle . . . or the Audi.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shut the door on that thought immediately. No. Don&#x2019;t think about him. Of course, I can afford a car&#x2014;a nice, new car. I suspect he has been overgenerous in his payment, and the thought leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, but I dismiss it and try to keep my mind as numb and as blank as possible. I can&#x2019;t think about him. I don&#x2019;t want to start crying again&#x2014;not out on the street.<br> &nbsp;<br> The apartment is empty. I miss Kate, and I imagine her lying on a beach in Barbados sipping a cool cocktail. I turn on the flat-screen television so there&#x2019;s noise to fill the vacuum and provide some semblance of company, but I don&#x2019;t listen or watch. I sit and stare blankly at the brick wall. I am numb. I feel nothing but the pain. How long must I endure this?<br> &nbsp;<br> The door buzzer startles me from my anguish, and my heart skips a beat. Who could that be? I press the intercom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Delivery for Ms. Steele.&#x201d; A bored, disembodied voice answers, and disappointment crashes through me. I listlessly make my way downstairs and find a young man noisily chewing gum, holding a large cardboard box, and leaning against the front door. I sign for the package and take it upstairs. The box is huge and surprisingly light. Inside are two dozen long-stemmed, white roses and a card.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Congratulations on your first day at work.</i><br> <i>I hope it went well.</i><br> <i>And thank you for the glider. That was very thoughtful.</i><br> <i>It has pride of place on my desk.</i><br> <i>Christian</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stare at the typed card, the hollow in my chest expanding. No doubt, his assistant sent this. Christian probably had very little to do with it. It&#x2019;s too painful to think about. I examine the roses&#x2014;they are beautiful, and I can&#x2019;t bring myself to throw them in the trash. Dutifully, I make my way into the kitchen to hunt down a vase.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so a pattern develops: wake, work, cry, sleep. Well, try to sleep. I can&#x2019;t even escape him in my dreams. Gray burning eyes, his lost look, his hair burnished and bright all haunt me. And the music . . . so much music&#x2014;I cannot bear to hear any music. I am careful to avoid it at all costs. Even the jingles in commercials make me shudder.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have spoken to no one, not even my mother or Ray. I don&#x2019;t have the capacity for idle talk now. No, I want none of it. I have become my own island state. A ravaged, war-torn land where nothing grows and the horizons are bleak. Yes, that&#x2019;s me. I can interact impersonally at work, but that&#x2019;s it. If I talk to Mom, I know I will break even further&#x2014;and I have nothing left to break.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I am finding it difficult to eat. By lunchtime on Wednesday, I manage a cup of yogurt, and it&#x2019;s the first thing I&#x2019;ve eaten since Friday. I am surviving on a newfound tolerance for lattes and Diet Coke. It&#x2019;s the caffeine that keeps me going, but it&#x2019;s making me anxious.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack has started to hover over me, irritating me, asking me personal questions. What does he want? I&#x2019;m polite, but I need to keep him at arm&#x2019;s length.<br> &nbsp;<br> I sit and begin trawling through a pile of correspondence addressed to him, and I&#x2019;m pleased with the distraction of menial work. My e-mail pings, and I quickly check to see who it&#x2019;s from.<br> &nbsp;<br> Holy shit. An e-mail from Christian. <i>Oh no, not here . . . not at work.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Christian Grey<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:05<br> To: Anastasia Steele<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear Anastasia<br> &nbsp;<br> Forgive this intrusion at work. I hope that it&#x2019;s going well. Did you get my flowers?<br> &nbsp;<br> I note that tomorrow is the gallery opening for your friend&#x2019;s show, and I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve not had time to purchase a car, and it&#x2019;s a long drive. I would be more than happy to take you&#x2014;should you wish.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let me know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christian Grey<br> CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tears swim in my eyes. I hastily leave my desk and bolt to the restroom to escape into one of the stalls. Josï¿½&#x2019;s show. I&#x2019;d forgotten all about it, and I promised him I&#x2019;d go. Shit, Christian is right; how am I going to get there?<br> &nbsp;<br> I clutch my forehead. Why hasn&#x2019;t Josï¿½ phoned? Come to think of it&#x2014;why hasn&#x2019;t anyone phoned? I&#x2019;ve been so absentminded I haven&#x2019;t noticed that my cell phone has been silent.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Shit!</i> I am such an idiot! I still have it set to forward calls to the BlackBerry. Holy hell. Christian&#x2019;s been getting my calls&#x2014;unless he&#x2019;s just thrown the BlackBerry away. How did he get my e-mail address?<br> &nbsp;<br> He knows my shoe size; an e-mail address is hardly going to present him with many problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> Can I see him again? Could I bear it? Do I want to see him? I close my eyes and tilt my head back as grief and longing lance through me. Of course I do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps&#x2014;perhaps I can tell him I&#x2019;ve changed my mind . . . No, no, no. I cannot be with someone who takes pleasure in inflicting pain on me, someone who can&#x2019;t love me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Torturous memories flash through my mind&#x2014;the gliding, holding hands, kissing, the bathtub, his gentleness, his humor, and his dark, brooding, sexy stare. I miss him. It&#x2019;s been five days, five days of agony that has felt like an eternity. I cry myself to sleep at night, wishing I hadn&#x2019;t walked out, wishing that he could be different, wishing that we were together. How long will this hideous overwhelming feeling last? I am in purgatory.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wrap my arms around my body, hugging myself tightly, holding myself together. I miss him. I really miss him . . . I love him. Simple.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Anastasia Steele, you are at work!</i> I must be strong, but I want to go to Josï¿½&#x2019;s show, and deep down, the masochist in me wants to see Christian. Taking a deep breath, I head back to my desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Anastasia Steele<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:25<br> To: Christian Grey<br> &nbsp;<br> Hi Christian<br> &nbsp;<br> Thank you for the flowers; they are lovely.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, I would appreciate a lift.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thank you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anastasia Steele<br> Assistant to Jack Hyde, Editor, SIP<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Checking my phone, I find that it is still set to forward calls to the BlackBerry. Jack is in a meeting, so I quickly call Josï¿½.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi, Josï¿½. It&#x2019;s Ana.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello, stranger.&#x201d; His tone is so warm and welcoming it&#x2019;s almost enough to push me over the edge again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t talk long. What time should I be there tomorrow for your show?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still coming?&#x201d; He sounds excited.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d; I smile my first genuine smile in five days as I picture his broad grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Seven thirty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See you then. Good-bye, Josï¿½.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bye, Ana.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Christian Grey<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:27<br> To: Anastasia Steele<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear Anastasia<br> &nbsp;<br> What time shall I pick you up?<br> &nbsp;<br> Christian Grey<br> CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Anastasia Steele<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:32<br> To: Christian Grey<br> &nbsp;<br> Josï¿½&#x2019;s show starts at 7:30. What time would you suggest?<br> &nbsp;<br> Anastasia Steele<br> Assistant to Jack Hyde, Editor, SIP<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Christian Grey<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:34<br> To: Anastasia Steele<br> &nbsp;<br> Dear Anastasia<br> &nbsp;<br> Portland is some distance away. I shall pick you up at 5:45.<br> &nbsp;<br> I look forward to seeing you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christian Grey<br> CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From: Anastasia Steele<br> Subject: Tomorrow<br> Date: June 8 2011 14:38<br> To: Christian Grey<br> &nbsp;<br> See you then.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anastasia Steele<br> Assistant to Jack Hyde, Editor, SIP<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh my. I&#x2019;m going to see Christian, and for the first time in five days, my spirits lift a fraction and I allow myself to wonder how he&#x2019;s been.<br> &nbsp;<br> Has he missed me? Probably not like I&#x2019;ve missed him. Has he found a new submissive? The thought is so painful that I dismiss it immediately. I look at the pile of correspondence I need to sort for Jack and tackle it as I try to push Christian out of my mind once more.<br> &nbsp;<br> That night in bed, I toss and turn, trying to sleep and it&#x2019;s the first time in a while I haven&#x2019;t cried myself to sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> In my mind&#x2019;s eye, I visualize Christian&#x2019;s face the last time I saw him as when I left. His tortured expression haunts me. I remember he didn&#x2019;t want me to go, which was odd. Why would I stay when things had reached such an impasse? We were each skirting around our own issues&#x2014;my fear of punishment, his fear of . . . what? Love?<br> &nbsp;<br> Turning on my side, I hug my pillow, filled with an overwhelming sadness. He thinks he doesn&#x2019;t deserve to be loved. Why does he feel that way? Does it have to do with his upbringing? His birth mom, the crack whore? My thoughts plague me into the early hours until eventually I fall into a fitful, exhausted sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The day drags and drags and Jack is unusually attentive. I suspect it&#x2019;s due to Kate&#x2019;s plum dress and the black high-heeled boots I&#x2019;ve stolen from her closet, but I don&#x2019;t dwell on the thought. I resolve to go clothes shopping with my first paycheck. The dress is looser on me than it was, but I pretend not to notice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally it&#x2019;s five thirty, and I collect my jacket and purse, trying to quell my nerves. <i>I&#x2019;m going to see him!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you have a date tonight?&#x201d; Jack asks as he strolls past my desk on his way out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. No. Not really.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He raises an eyebrow, his interest clearly piqued. &#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I flush. &#x201c;No, a friend. An ex-boyfriend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe tomorrow you&#x2019;d like to come for a drink after work. You&#x2019;ve had a stellar first week, Ana. We should celebrate.&#x201d; He smiles and an unknown, unsettling emotion flits across his face, making me uneasy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Putting his hands in his pockets, he saunters through the double doors. I frown at his retreating back. Drinks with the boss, is that a good idea?<br> &nbsp;<br> I shake my head. I have an evening of Christian Grey to get through first. How am I going to do this? I hurry into the restroom to make last-minute adjustments.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the large mirror on the wall, I take a long, hard look at my face. I&#x2019;m my usual pale self, dark circles around my too-large eyes. I look gaunt, haunted. I wish I knew how to use makeup. I apply some mascara and eyeliner and pinch my cheeks, hoping for some color. Tidying my hair so that it hangs artfully down my back, I take a deep breath. This will have to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nervously I walk through the foyer with a smile and a wave to Claire at Reception. I think she and I could become friends. Jack is talking to Elizabeth as I head for the doors. Smiling broadly, he hurries over to open them for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After you, Ana,&#x201d; he murmurs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; I smile, embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside on the curb, Taylor is waiting. He opens the rear door of the car. I glance hesitantly at Jack, who has followed me out. He&#x2019;s looking toward the Audi SUV in dismay.<br> &nbsp;<br> I turn and climb into the back, and there he sits&#x2014;Christian Grey&#x2014;wearing his gray suit, no tie, white shirt open at the collar. His gray eyes are glowing.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mouth dries. He looks glorious except he&#x2019;s scowling at me. Why?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When did you last eat?&#x201d; he snaps as Taylor closes the door behind me.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Crap.</i> &#x201c;Hello, Christian. Yes, it&#x2019;s nice to see you, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want your smart mouth now. Answer me.&#x201d; His eyes blaze.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Holy shit.</i> &#x201c;Um . . . I had a yogurt at lunchtime. Oh&#x2014;and a banana.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When did you last have a real meal?&#x201d; he asks acidly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taylor slips into the driver&#x2019;s seat, starts the car, and pulls out into the traffic.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glance up and Jack is waving at me, though how he can see me through the dark glass, I don&#x2019;t know. I wave back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Christian snaps.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My boss.&#x201d; I peek up at the beautiful man beside me, and his mouth is pressed into a hard line.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well? Your last meal?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian, that really is none of your concern,&#x201d; I murmur, feeling extraordinarily brave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whatever you do concerns me. Tell me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>No, it doesn&#x2019;t.</i> I groan in frustration, rolling my eyes heavenward, and Christian narrows his eyes. And for the first time in a long time, I want to laugh. I try hard to stifle the giggle that thre...</p><h2>Biblia sacra: Iuxta Vulgatam versionem (Latin Edition)</h2><p>Hardcover, no dust jacket.

Some of these individuals include Johannes Reinhardt, who left his family's winery in Germany in the middle of the night to begin his search for new life; Morten Hallgren, the brilliant astrophysicist-turned-winemaker who came to rebuild his dream after losing his family winery in France; Dave Whiting, who hosts one of several secret society groups in the region; and Peter and Joanna Bell, who recounted the near-death experiences and chance encounters that had set their course for a winemaking region the once knew nothing about.<br> <br> <i>Summer in a Glass</i> is "not too technical, with just the right amount of explanation when needed, while always staying focused on the personas rather than just the numbers," writes James Molesworth in the book's foreword.

The Life Goals Program (LGP) was developed by two of the authors, Mark Bauer and Linda McBride, and has undergone two clinical trials, with more ongoing. <p> The LGP was designed to help the bipolar patient take charge of their disorder, rather than waiting passively for a health practitioner to stumble on the right treatment and tell the patient how to deal with the disorder. It includes a strong educational component, encouraging the person living with bipolar disorder to both learn about the disorder as well as explore their experiences with bipolar, including beliefs, first onset, triggers, cycles, feelings of stigma, effects of the disorder on social and spiritual aspects of life, and effective coping methods. Rather than creating a dichotomy where the person living with bipolar disorder is the passive patient and the health care provider (the author) is the expert, the LGP encourages the person living with bipolar disorder to become an expert on his or her disorder, and to take action in discovering what works and doesn't work in controlling the symptoms and coping with the effects of bipolar. </p><p> This workbook is arranged in modules, each one beginning with an educational component that explains the topic at hand and its relation to bipolar (for example, what happens physiologically when the person living with bipolar disorder becomes depressed, or how and why bipolar people often turn to street drugs and alcohol to cope). It then provides a step-by-step, accessible, thorough group of tools and/or exercises to help the reader explore the topic using their own experience. </p></p><p>In <b>Overcoming Bipolar Disorder</b>, a prestigious team of researchers and experts on bipolar disorder presents this research-based program for helping people with bipolar disorder manage symptoms, explore triggers and coping responses, and develop a comprehensive plan for living a full life based on core values and goals.Mark S.

In a labyrinth of canyons in the American Southwest where virtually nothing else is alive - barely any vegetation, few signs of wildlife, and scant traces of any human precursors - Childs and his friend Dirk undertake a fortnight's journey. With as much food and gear as they can carry, and little else but their wiles to help them traverse the inhospitable, unmappable terrain, the two men assume the life-or-death challenge of exploring this land - and of then finding a way out.<br>Equally gripping as their adventure in the wild is the parallel story, told in flashback, of what has propelled the two men into these extreme circumstances.

Neither was hair matted with old sweat, or eyes red with lack of sleep. She accepted the fact that on this particular morning, mirrors were <i>not </i>going to be her friend. Luckily, she didn't have many of them in the small quarters she called home. She got out of bed slowly, studiously avoided the short hall that led from her bolted doors to the kitchen, the closets and the large space she lived in otherwise, and lifted clothing from beneath a rumpled pile, examining it carefully.</p> <p>It sort of looked clean.</p> <p>She pulled the linen tunic over her head, cursed as her hair caught in the strings that secured it and yanked, hard. Shadows fell over the ledge of her single window, stretching across the floor at an ominous angle. She was going to be late. Again.</p> <p>Pants were less tricky; she only had a few, and chose the black leather ones. They were, at the moment, the only ones she owned that weren't cut, torn or bloody.</p> <p>She'd have to ask Iron Jaw for a better clothing allowance. Or more time to spend the pittance she <i>did </i>have.</p> <p>The mirror in the hall began to glow, and she cursed under her breath. She'd clearly have to ask him on a<i> different</i> morning.</p> <p>"Coming," she muttered.</p> <p>The mirror flashed, light hanging in the room like an extended, time-slowed bolt of lightning. Iron Jaw was in a lousy mood, and it wasn't even lunch. He <i>hated </i>to use the mirrors.</p> <p>She buttoned up her pants, pulled on her boots and sidled her way toward the mirror, hoping that the light was the effect of lack of sleep. Not much hope there, really.</p> <p>"Kaylin, where the <i>hell </i>have you been?"</p> <p>No, the mirror this morning was definitely not her friend. She pulled her hair up, curled it in a tight bun and shoved the nearest stick she could find through its center. Then she picked up the belt on the table just to the left of that mirror and donned it, adjusting dagger hilts so they didn't butt against her lower ribs.</p> <p>"Kaylin Neya, you'd better answer soon. I know you're there."</p> <p>Putting on her best we-both-know-it's-fake smile, she walked over to the mirror and said, sweetly, "Good morning, Marcus."</p> <p>He growled.</p> <p>Not a particularly encouraging sign, given that Marcus was Leontine, and had a bad habit of ripping the throats out of people who were stupid enough to annoy him. His lower fangs were in evidence as he snarled. But his eyes, cat eyes, were wide and unblinking in the golden fur that adorned his face, and his fur was not&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;yet&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;standing on end. His hands, however, were behind his back, and his broad chest was adorned with the full flowing robes of the Hawks.</p> <p>Official dress. In the morning. Gods, she was going to be in trouble.</p> <p>"Morning was two hours ago," he snapped.</p> <p>"You're in fancy dress," she said, changing the subject about as clumsily as she ever did.</p> <p>"And you look like shit. What the hell were you doing last night?"</p> <p>"None of your business."</p> <p>"Good answer," he growled. "Why don't you try it on the Hawklord?"</p> <p>She groaned. "What day is it?"</p> <p>"The fourth," he replied.</p> <p>Fourth? She counted back, and realized that she'd lost a day. Again. "I'm missing something, aren't I?"</p> <p>"Brains," he snapped. "And survival instinct. The Hawk-lord's been waiting for you for three hours."</p> <p>"Tell him I'm dead."</p> <p>"You will be if you don't get your ass in here." He muttered something else, a series of growls that she knew, from experience, meant something disparaging about humans. She let it pass. "I'll be there in half an hour."</p> <p>"Dressed like that? You'll be out in thirty-five. On your ass."</p> <p>She put her palm on the mirror's surface, cutting him off and scattering his image. Then she went to her closet and began to really <i>move.</i></p> <p>Bathed, cleaned, groomed and in the full dress uniform of the Hawks&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;which still involved the only intact pants she owned&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Kaylin approached the front of the forbidding stone halls ruled by the three Lords of Law: The Lord of Wolves, the Lord of Swords and the Lord of Hawks. At least that's what they were called on official documents and in polite company, of which Kaylin knew surprisingly little.</p> <p>The Swords were the city's peacekeepers, something ill-suited to Kaylin; the Wolves were its hunters, and often, its killers. And the Hawks? The city's eyes. Ears. The people who actually <i>solved </i>crimes.</p> <p>Then again, she would think that; Kaylin had been a Hawk for the entire time she'd been involved on the right side of the law, and didn't speak about the years that preceded it much.</p> <p>By writ of the Emperor of Karaazon, the Halls of Law were the only standing structures allowed to approach the height of the Imperial palace, and the three towers, set against a wide stretch of expensive ground in the shape of a triangle, flew the flags of the Lords of Law: the Hawk, the Wolf and the Sword. From her vantage, they could hardly be seen; she was too close. But from the rest of the city? They never rested.</p> <p>Neither, she thought, did the people who served them. She was damn tired.</p> <p>The front doors were always manned, and she recognized Tanner and Clint as they lowered their pole-arms, barring her way. It was the Hawk's month for guard duty; they shared rotation of that honor with the Swords. The Wolves, lazy bastards, weren't considered fit for dress duty. Or ritual entries.</p> <p>She hated ritual.</p> <p>Clint and Tanner didn't love it much better than she did.</p> <p>"Kaylin, where the hell have you been?" Tanner asked. It was the refrain that punctuated too much of her daily existence.</p> <p>"Getting cleaned up, if you must know."</p> <p>Tanner was, at six and a half feet, tall even for a human. His helm was strictly a dress helm, and it gleamed bronze in the afternoon sunlight, running from the capped height of his head down the line of his nose, as if it were a bird's mask. To either side of the metal, his eyes were a dark, deep brown.</p> <p>Clint shook his head, and the glinting helm's light left an after-image in her vision. But he smiled. He was about two inches shorter than Tanner, and his skin was the dark ebony of the Southern stretch. She loved the sound of his voice, and he knew it.</p> <p>It wasn't the only thing she loved about him. "You've got to give up the moonlighting," he told her.</p> <p>"When the pay here doesn't suck."</p> <p>He laughed out loud, his halberd shaking as he began to lift it. "You really didn't get much sleep, did you? Iron Jaw has ears like a Barrani&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;he'll have your hide on his wall as a dartboard."</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. "Can I go now?"</p> <p>"Your doom," he said, his voice still sweet with the sound of amused laughter. But his expression gained a moment's gravity as he leaned forward and lowered that voice into a fold of deep velvet. "Sesti told me."</p> <p>"Sesti told you what?"</p> <p>"What you were doing the past two days."</p> <p>"Tell her to piss off next time you see her."</p> <p>He laughed again. She could spend all day making him laugh, just for the thrill of the deep rich tones of that voice. But if she did it today? It would be her last day. She smiled.</p> <p>"That won't be until his naming day." Aerian men were forbidden the birthing caves&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;unless those caves held the dead or the dying. Even then, they could come to claim their wives, no more. Kaylin had never understood this.</p> <p>"When are you off duty?" she asked him.</p> <p>"About two hours."</p> <p>"You haven't been home yet?"</p> <p>"Not yet."</p> <p>"Sesti had a boy. Healthy, but his feathers were a <i>mess. </i>Took us three hours to clean 'em down."</p> <p>"Always does," he said with an affectionate shrug. "Go on. Iron Jaw's been biting anyone who gets in reach."</p> <p>She nodded, walked past and then turning, reached out to touch the soft, ash gray of Clint's wings. They snapped up and out beneath her fingers.</p> <p>"You haven't changed in seven years," he told her, turning. "Don't <i>touch </i>the flight feathers."</p> <p>If the exterior of the Halls of Law was forbidding, the interior was hardly less so. The front doors opened into a hall that not even cathedrals could boast. It rose three storeys, and across its vaulted ceilings, frescoes had been painted&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Hawk, Wolf and Sword, trailing light and shadow in a grim depiction of various hunts. Sunlight streamed in from a window that was at least as tall, and certainly more impressive; the colors of the paint were protected from sunlight, and always on display, a reminder to newcomers of what the Halls meant to those who displeased their rulers.</p> <p>But this hall was not meant to intimidate; it was built with a practical purpose in mind&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;which wasn't true of many of the Imperial buildings. The Aerians that served the Lords of Law did not walk easily in the confined, cramped space of regular human halls. Clint, armed and armored, could easily take to the air in the confines of the rising stone walls, and high, high above her, the perch of the Aerie loomed; she had seen him reach it many, many times. Aerians circled above her, against the backdrop of colored fresco, and as always, she envied them their ability to truly fly.</p> <p>The closest she'd ever gotten involved a long drop that had almost ended her life. She wasn't eager to repeat it.</p> <p>And if the Hawklord had really been waiting for three&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; close to four&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;hours now, she didn't give much for her chances. She began to run.</p></p><h2>On The Christian Meaning Of Human Suffering</h2><p>Salvifici Doloris On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering Apostolic Letter of John Paul II</p><p></p><h2>The Good Life Lab: Radical Experiments in Hands-On Living</h2><p><p>Tired of the high-pressure life they lead in New York City, Wendy Jehanara Tremayne and her husband migrate to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, where they build, invent, forage, and grow all they need for themselves.

She lives in South Danbury, New Hampshire. Visit www.marylynray.com.Human industriousness saves the day-and the land-in this ecological cautionary tale. When a man discovers that the beloved field across the way is for sale, he goes to great lengths to protect it from developers. When selling all his possessions fails to yield sufficient cash, the man plants a huge patch of pumpkins in the plot. The bountiful harvest enables him to purchase the field, and to keep it in its natural state. Ray's text puts forth a noble premise and a pleasing ending, but its logic makes a slight misstep when it ventures into the fantastic: the man decides to send the pumpkins-via truck, plane and magic carpet-all over the world for sale, rather than completing the transactions closer to home. The author's underlying sense of urgency effectively demonstrates the importance of conservation, and may even have a motivational effect on readers. Root's watereolor and gouache paintings emit a predominantly orange glow, and the expanse of the scenes clearly renders the field and its crop as the true stars here. The gentle play of light and shadow on the horizon lends a becoming sense of serenity. Even the Great Pumpkin himself would be pleased.

Invisible fingers wrapped around her throat and pressed down hard on her windpipe, cutting off her supply of oxygen, rendering her dizzy and light-headed. I&#x2019;m having a heart attack, Robin thought. I can&#x2019;t breathe. I&#x2019;m going to die.<br><br>The middle-aged woman sitting across from her didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She was too engrossed in her own troubles. Something about an overbearing mother-in-law, a difficult daughter, and a less-than-supportive husband.<br><br>Okay, get a grip. Concentrate. The woman&#x2014;what the hell was her name?&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t paying her a hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour to receive a blank stare back in response. At the very least, she expected Robin to be paying attention. You didn&#x2019;t go to a therapist to watch her have a nervous breakdown.<br><br>You are not having a nervous breakdown, Robin admonished herself, recognizing the familiar symptoms. This isn&#x2019;t a heart attack. It is a panic attack, plain and simple. You&#x2019;ve had them before. God knows you should be used to them by now.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s been more than five years, she thought with her next breath. The panic attacks she used to experience on an almost daily basis were part of her past. Except the past is always with you. Isn&#x2019;t that what they say?<br><br>Robin didn&#x2019;t have to wonder what had brought on the sudden attack. She knew exactly what&#x2014;who&#x2014;was responsible. Melanie, she thought, picturing her sister, older by three years, and thinking, not for the first time, that if you removed the L from her sister&#x2019;s name, it spelled &#x201c;Meanie.&#x201d;<br><br>A message from Melanie had been waiting on her voice mail when she&#x2019;d returned to her office after lunch. Robin had listened to the message, debating whether to return the call or simply pretend she&#x2019;d never received it. In the midst of her deliberations, her client had arrived. You&#x2019;ll just have to wait, she&#x2019;d informed her sister silently, grabbing her notepad and entering the room she reserved for counseling clients.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; the woman asked her now, leaning forward in her upholstered blue chair and eyeing Robin suspiciously. &#x201c;You look kind of funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could you excuse me for just a minute?&#x201d; Robin was out of her seat before the woman could answer. She returned to the smaller room off her main office and shut the door. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she whispered, leaning against her desk with the palms of both hands, careful not to look at the phone. &#x201c;Breathe. Just breathe.&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, you&#x2019;ve identified what&#x2019;s happening. You know what caused it. All you have to do now is relax and concentrate on your breathing. You have a client in the next room waiting for you. You don&#x2019;t have time for this crap. Pull yourself together. What was it her mother used to say? This too shall pass.<br><br>Except not everything passed. And if it did, it often circled back to bite you in the ass. &#x201c;Okay, take deep breaths,&#x201d; she counseled herself again. &#x201c;Now another one.&#x201d; Three more and her breathing had almost returned to normal. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>Except it wasn&#x2019;t okay, and she knew it. Melanie was calling for a reason, and whatever that reason was, it wasn&#x2019;t good. The sisters had barely exchanged two words since their mother died, and none at all since Robin had left Red Bluff for good after their father&#x2019;s hasty remarriage. Nothing in almost six years. Not a congratulatory note after Robin graduated from Berkeley with a master&#x2019;s degree in psychology, no best wishes when she&#x2019;d opened her own practice the following year, not even a casual &#x201c;good luck&#x201d; when she and Blake had announced their engagement.<br><br>And so, two years ago, with Blake&#x2019;s encouragement and support, Robin had ceased all attempts at communication with her sister. Wasn&#x2019;t she always advising clients to stop banging their heads against the wall when faced with an immovable object and insurmountable odds? Wasn&#x2019;t it time she followed her own sage counsel?<br><br>Of course, it was always easier to give advice than it was to take it.<br><br>And now, out of the blue, her sister was calling and leaving cryptic messages on her voice mail. Like a cancer you thought had been excised, only to have it come roaring back, more virulent than ever.<br><br>&#x201c;Call me&#x201d; was the enigmatic message Melanie had left, not bothering to state her name, taking for granted that Robin would recognize her voice even after all this time.<br><br>Which, of course, she had. Melanie&#x2019;s voice was a hard one to get out of your head, no matter how many years had passed.<br><br>What fresh hell is this? Robin wondered, taking several more deep breaths and refusing to speculate. Experience had taught her that her imagination couldn&#x2019;t compete with her reality. Not by a long shot.<br><br>She debated calling Blake, then decided against it. He was busy and wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate being interrupted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the therapist,&#x201d; he would tell her, his eyes wandering to a space behind her head, as if someone more interesting had just walked into view.<br><br>Pushing thoughts of Blake and Melanie out of her mind, Robin tucked her chin-length curly blond hair behind her ears and returned to the other room, forcing her lips into a reassuring smile. &#x201c;Sorry about that,&#x201d; she told the woman waiting, who was a first-time client and whose name Robin was still unable to recall. Emma or Emily. Something like that.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d; the woman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine. I just felt a bit queasy for a second there.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not pregnant, are you? I&#x2019;d hate to start this process only to see you quit to have a baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m not pregnant.&#x201d; You have to have sex to get pregnant, Robin thought. And she and Blake hadn&#x2019;t made love in over a month. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; she said, trying desperately to recall the woman&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;Please, go on. You were saying . . .&#x201d;<br><br>What the hell had the woman been saying?<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, well, I was saying that my husband is absolutely useless as far as his mother is concerned. It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s ten years old again and he&#x2019;s afraid to open his mouth. She says the most hurtful things to me, and he acts like he doesn&#x2019;t hear any of it. Then when I point it out, he says I&#x2019;m exaggerating, and I shouldn&#x2019;t let her get to me. But my daughter has picked up on it, of course. And now she&#x2019;s being just as rude. You should hear the way she talks to me.&#x201d;<br><br>You think you have problems? Robin thought. You think your family is difficult?<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why my mother-in-law hates me so much.&#x201d;<br><br>She doesn&#x2019;t need a reason. If she&#x2019;s anything like my sister, she despises you on principle. Because you exist.<br><br>It was true. Melanie had hated her baby sister from the first moment she&#x2019;d laid eyes on her. She&#x2019;d been instantly jealous of their mother&#x2019;s suddenly divided attention. She would pinch Robin while she lay sleeping in her crib, not stopping until the infant was covered in tiny bruises; she&#x2019;d hacked off Robin&#x2019;s beautiful curls with scissors when she was two; when Robin was seven, Melanie had pushed her into a wall during a supposedly friendly game of tag, breaking her nose. She was constantly criticizing Robin&#x2019;s choice of clothes, her choice of interests, her choice of friends. &#x201c;The girl&#x2019;s a stupid slut,&#x201d; Melanie had sneered about Robin&#x2019;s best friend, Tara.<br><br>Oh, wait&#x2014;she was right about that.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done everything to make peace with that woman. I&#x2019;ve taken her shopping. I&#x2019;ve taken her for lunch. I invite her to have dinner at our house at least three times a week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Robin asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; the woman repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;If she&#x2019;s so unpleasant, why bother?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because my husband thinks it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then let him take her shopping and out to lunch. She&#x2019;s his mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that simple,&#x201d; the woman demurred.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s exactly that simple,&#x201d; Robin countered. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s rude and disrespectful. You&#x2019;re under no obligation to put up with that. Stop taking her shopping and to lunch. Stop inviting her over for dinner. If she asks you why, tell her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will I say to my husband?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That you&#x2019;re tired of being disrespected and you&#x2019;re not going to put up with it anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s stopping you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s complicated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br><br>You want complicated? I&#x2019;ll give you complicated: My parents were married for twenty-four years, during which time my father cheated on my mother with every skank who caught his roving eye, including my best friend, Tara, whom he married five short months after my mother died. And just to make matters truly interesting, at the time, Tara was engaged to my brother, Alec. How&#x2019;s that for complicated?<br><br>Oh, wait&#x2014;there&#x2019;s more.<br><br>Tara has a daughter, the product of a failed first marriage when she was barely out of her teens. Cassidy would be twelve now, I guess. Cute kid. My father adores her, has shown her more love than he ever gave any of his own kids. Speaking of which, did I mention that I haven&#x2019;t talked to my sister in almost six years?<br><br>&#x201c;Some people are toxic,&#x201d; Robin said out loud. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best to have as little to do with them as possible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even when they&#x2019;re family?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially when they&#x2019;re family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;I thought therapists were supposed to ask questions and let you figure things out for yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>Were they? God, that could take years. &#x201c;Just thought I&#x2019;d save us both some time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re tough,&#x201d; the woman said.<br><br>Robin almost laughed. &#x201c;Tough&#x201d; was probably the last word she would have used to describe herself. Melanie was the tough one. Or maybe &#x201c;angry&#x201d; was the right word. For as long as Robin could remember, Melanie had been angry. At the world in general. At Robin in particular. Although to be fair, it hadn&#x2019;t always been easy for Melanie. Hell, it had never been easy for her.<br><br>Double hell, Robin thought. Who wants to be fair?<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re all right?&#x201d; the woman asked. &#x201c;Your face . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with my face?&#x201d; Am I having a stroke? Is it Bell&#x2019;s palsy? What&#x2019;s the matter with my face?<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. It just got all scrunched up for a second there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Scrunched up?&#x201d; Robin realized she was shouting.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean to upset you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you excuse me for another minute?&#x201d; Robin propelled herself from her chair with such force that it almost tipped over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; She opened the outer door to her office and bolted into the gray-carpeted hallway, running down the narrow corridor until she reached the washroom. Pushing the door open, she darted toward the sink to check her image in the mirror. An attractive thirty-three-year-old woman with deep blue eyes, pleasantly full lips, and a vaguely heart-shaped face stared back at her. There were no unsavory warts or blemishes, no noticeable scars or abnormalities. Everything was where it was supposed to be, if a little off-kilter because of her slightly crooked nose. But there was nothing that could be described as &#x201c;scrunched up.&#x201d; Her hair could use a touch-up and a trim, she realized, but other than that, she looked decent enough, even professional, in her rose-colored blouse and straight gray skirt. She could stand to put on a few pounds, she thought, hearing Melanie&#x2019;s voice in her ear reminding her that despite her achievements and &#x201c;fancy degree,&#x201d; she was still &#x201c;flat as a pancake&#x201d; and &#x201c;skinny like a stick.&#x201d;<br><br>She felt the stirrings of another panic attack and took a series of preventive deep breaths. When that didn&#x2019;t work, she splashed a handful of cold water on her face. &#x201c;Okay, calm down,&#x201d; she told herself. &#x201c;Calm down. Everything is fine. Except your face is all scrunched up.&#x201d; She examined her reflection once more, noting her pursed lips and pinched cheeks and making a concerted effort to relax her features. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t let Melanie get to you.&#x201d; She took another series of deep breaths&#x2014;in through the nose, out through the mouth, inhale the good energy, exhale the bad. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a woman patiently awaiting your wise counsel,&#x201d; she reminded herself. &#x201c;Now, get back there and give it to her.&#x201d; Whatever the hell her name is.<br><br>But when Robin returned to her office, the woman was gone. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Robin called, opening the door to her inner office and discovering that room empty as well. &#x201c;Adeline?&#x201d; She returned to the exterior hallway and found it likewise deserted. Great. Fine time to remember her name.<br><br>Obviously, Adeline had fled. Scared off by Robin&#x2019;s &#x201c;tough&#x201d; facade and &#x201c;scrunched-up&#x201d; face. Not that Robin blamed her. The session had been a disaster. What gave her the right to think she could counsel others when she herself was such a complete and utter fuckup?<br><br>Robin plopped down into the blue chair that Adeline had abandoned and looked around the thoughtfully arranged space. The walls were a pale but sunny yellow, meant to encourage optimism. A poster of colorful flowers hung on the wall opposite the door, meant to suggest growth and personal development. A photograph of autumn leaves was situated beside the door to her inner sanctum, a subtle reminder that change was both good and inevitable. Her personal favorite&#x2014;a collage depicting a curly-haired woman with glasses and a worried smile amidst a flurry of happy faces and abstract raindrops, the capitalized words why do i get so emotional? floating above her head&#x2014;occupied the place of honor behind the chair she usually sat in. It was intended to be humorous and put clients at ease. She&#x2019;d found it at a neighborhood garage sale soon after she and Blake had moved in together. Now he was increasingly &#x201c;working late.&#x201d; How long before he brought up the idea of moving out?<br><br>&#x201c;Why do I get so emotional indeed?&#x201d; she asked the woman in the collage.<br><br>The woman smiled her worried smile and said nothing.<br><br>The phone in Robin&#x2019;s inner office rang.<br><br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she said, listening as it rang two more times before voice mail picked up. Was it Melanie, phoning to berate her for not returning her previous call promptly enough? Robin pushed herself slowly to her feet. What the hell, might as well get this over with.<br><br>The first thing she saw when she entered the adjoining room was the telephone&#x2019;s blinking red light. She sank into the comfortable burgundy leather chair behind her small oak desk, a desk that had been Blake&#x2019;s when he first began practicing law; he&#x2019;d passed it on to her when he graduated to a bigger firm with a bigger office, one that required a more imposing desk.<br><br>Was that why they&#x2019;d never followed through on their plans to marry? Was she not sufficiently imposing for a man of his growing stature?<br><br>Or maybe it was the pretty new assistant he&#x2019;d hired, or the attractive young lawyer in the next office. Perhaps the woman he&#x2019;d smiled at while waiting in line at Starbucks had been the source of second thoughts on his part.<br><br>How long could she continue to ignore the all-too-familiar signs?<br><br>She picked up the receiver, listened as a recorded voice informed her that she had one new message and one saved message. &#x201c;To listen to your message, press one-one.&#x201d;<br><br>Robin did as directed.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, this is Adeline Sullivan,&#x201d; the voice said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling to apologize for running out on you like that. I just didn&#x2019;t think we were a good fit, and to quote a therapist I know, &#x2018;I thought I&#x2019;d save us both some time&#x2019; and just leave. I hope you aren&#x2019;t angry. You can bill me for the session. You did give me some things to think about.&#x201d; She left the address where Robin could send the invoice. Robin promptly erased the message. Would that everything else was so easy to erase. She closed her eyes, her fingers hovering over the phone&#x2019;s keypad.<br><br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; she urged herself. &#x201c;You can do this.&#x201d; She pressed the button to lis...</p><h2>Kid-Friendly ADHD and Autism Cookbook</h2><p>The best kid-friendly recipes and guide to the gluten-free milk-free diet for ADHD and Autism.<b>What it is. Why it works. How to do it.</b><p>The Centers for Disease Control reports significant increases in Autism and ADHD - both affecting primarily boys. The CDC estimates that 1 out of 175 children (age 4 to 17) currently have Autism (300,000). Before 1985, Autism occurred in less than 1 out of 2000. ADHD is much more common in that it affects 4.4 million U.S. children (age 4 to 17).</p><p>Common to both of these conditions is the negative impact of certain foods - especially milk products and glutens such as wheat(and to a lesser degree - soy and corn.) One of the challenges that parents face is coping with children who have picky appetites and crave the very foods that affect their behavior, focus and development. The other challenge is finding ways to get their children to eat healthy foods and improve their nutritional status.</p><p>The uniqueness of this book is that it not only provides gluten-free milk-free substitutes and recipes, it provides successful suggestions for feeding the picky eater. The authors share details about just how and why the diet works. The specialty ingredients are explained and extensive sources provided.

HEALTH Autistic spectrum disorders continue to be a major topic in the news. This mysterious group of developmental disorders still has no known cause, but those who have them seem to have a high incidence of digestive problems. Dietary interventions often lead to improved functioning. These three books offer information about diets and recipes that appeal to children. Strickland, a registered dietitian specializing in ADHD and autism, offers the most detail, explaining the importance of good nutrition for development and discussing food allergies and the use of special diets, vitamins, and supplements. Compart, a developmental pediatrician and Laake, a registered dietitian, cover the gluten-free, casein-free diet and its use in treating both ADHD and autism. They explain what the diet is, why it works, and how to transition a child onto it. Kid-friendly recipes make up the book&#x2019;s core. There is also a resource list. Kessick, a British autism advocate who has an autistic son, presents the shortest book, which features a brief history of dietary intervention in treating autism and material on the implementation of a special diet at home and at school.

American journalist Brian Hall spent the spring and summer of 1991 traveling through Yugoslavia, even as the nation was crumbling in his footsteps. Having arrived a week after the catalytic May 2 massacre at Borovo Selo, he watched a political solutions were abandoned with dizzying speed, and as Yugoslavia s various ethnicities, which had managed to reach a point of tolerant coexistence, tipped into the violence of civil war.</p><p>Brian Hall is the author of three novels, including <b>I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company</b>, his acclaimed story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, as well as three works of nonfiction.An incisive and affecting Yugoslavian travelogue from May to mid-September 1991, just as the country split up and its former republics went to war. Hall (Stealing from a Deep Place, 1988, etc.) professes no solutions for the current Balkan trauma. Rather, he offers an elegy of sorts for the promise of humanism and an eyewitness account of the balkanization of mind and action. ``Even intellectuals in Yugoslavia tend to think the truth is not only knowable, but obvious,'' Hall writes, and he unravels that in lively scenes and portraits, mostly of ordinary people but also of Serbian president Slobodan Miloevi and the wearied Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovi. He describes the weirdness of Sarajevo television news, the slant of the stories dependent on the reporter's ethnicity. He traces the tortured rationalizations behind Croatians' defense of their not-so-unique language. He suggests that supportive audience members give a Serbian opposition press conference the feel of a revival meeting. Hall has a good grasp of the ironies of history (the Serbs claim the legacy of both the partisans and the Chetniks, who opposed each other in WW II) and of the present (Croatia's leading antidemocrats aren't home-grown- -they're &#x201a;migr&#x201a;s from Australia and Canada). In multiethnic Bosnia, the microcosm of Yugoslavia, he drinks local-style coffee with Sarajevans yearning for reconciliation, their cosmopolitan ``private dream'' not shared by those in the divided countryside. In Kosovo, Hall finds a bearded Albanian passing as a Serb and maintaining an eight-year secret relationship with his girlfriend from home. Only in Kosovo, Hall observes, do old rural traditions remain intact despite the ``self-vaunting'' talk about Croat, Serb, or Muslim culture. Understandably incomplete as a tale of recent history, but a worthy aid to understanding Yugoslavia's demise. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, in Enchantment, Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure.<p>The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm.</p><p>Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest--or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy's fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it.</p><p>This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.</p><p>A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.</p><p><br>Like countless others I was mesmerized by Scott Card's seminal Ender's Saga. But it wasn't until I read his other books when I realized just what a brilliant writer Card really is. Books like Treason, Dispatches of Christopher Columbus, the Alvin-Maker series and Wyrms were just as good as Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead yet so completly different. Which brings me to ENCHANTMENT. In this book Scott has written something perhaps no one but himself exepcted to write - a love story. And what an engaging story this is. One never knows what to expect from Orson Scott Card, except he always manage to astound and surprise, and ENCHANTMENT is Card at top-form!<br>--Kuo-Yu Liang, Associate Publisher, Del Rey Books</p><p>Orson Scott Card is one of those writers who never fails to amaze me. His extraordinary language and imagination draw me into his stories, but its<br>his characters that keep me glued to the page. They feel so real to me that I find myself nodding in agreement and thinking, "yes, that's exactly the<br>way life is" or "that's just how a person would react in that situation." His work is so rich that I can read the same book over and over and find<br>something different and wonderful each time.</p><p>Enchantment does all this and more. In addition to showcasing all of Card's hallmark talents, this novel breaks new ground -- no small feat for a<br>writer of such high calibre. <br>--Amy Stout, Editor, Del Rey Books</p></p><h2>Melmoth: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Masterful...scary and smart, working as a horror story but also a philosophical inquiry into the nature of will and love.

A desire to be exceptional may not in itself strike you as unusual. Everyone, as a kid, has daydreams in which he catches the touchdown pass as time expires to win the Super Bowl, or she pole-vaults sixteen feet to win an Olympic gold medal. But I&#x2019;m not talking about daydreams or about the unrealized fantasies of many adults. I&#x2019;m talking about a desire so fierce that it changes a person&#x2019;s life. Exceptional people begin with just such ambitions. From them, I&#x2019;ve learned how a champion&#x2019;s thoughts are different from the thoughts of most people. That difference is what this book is about.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve worked with the winners of eighty-four major golf championships on the men&#x2019;s, women&#x2019;s, and senior tours. I&#x2019;ve worked with Olympic gold medalists in the equestrian sports. I&#x2019;ve worked with NCAA champions in track and field, soccer, lacrosse, and basketball. I&#x2019;ve worked with winners of major tennis tournaments. Three of the five players in the history of the PGA Tour to shoot a competitive 59&#x2014;Chip Beck, David Duval, and Jim Furyk&#x2014;were working with me when they did it. I&#x2019;ve worked with exceptionally successful people in the entertainment and business worlds. Each of them has taught me something about the minds of exceptional people.<br> <br>They have confirmed my belief that the ideas people choose to have about themselves largely determine the quality of the lives they lead. We can choose to believe in ourselves, and thus to strive, to risk, to persevere, and to achieve. Or we can choose to cling to security and mediocrity. We can choose to set no limits on ourselves, to set high goals and dream big dreams. We can use those dreams to fuel our spirits with passion. Or we can become philosophers of the worst kind, inventing ways to rationalize our failures, inventing excuses for mediocrity. We can fall in love with our own abilities and our own potential, then choose to maximize those abilities. Or we can decide that we have no special talents or abilities and try to be happy being safe and comfortable.<br> <br>As I&#x2019;ve worked, I&#x2019;ve been troubled at times by the realization that the champions I know are becoming more atypical&#x2014;too exceptional, if you will. Our grandparents and great-grandparents migrated and struggled for many years to give us the freedom we now have, a precious birthright. We&#x2019;re free to choose what we&#x2019;re going to think about ourselves. No one can stop us from chasing our dreams. Yet many people today choose to squander this birthright. They choose to believe that because of where they were born or who their parents are, they don&#x2019;t have a fair chance in life. They&#x2019;re choosing to believe that the competition&#x2014;from America and around the world&#x2014;is just too tough. They&#x2019;re choosing to believe in someone else&#x2019;s talent more than their own. They&#x2019;re choosing to be mediocre.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m always telling people that I don&#x2019;t care what their families or their schools or their communities said or thought about them. I tell them, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an adult now, and you get to decide.&#x201d; So what&#x2019;s the decision going to be? You get to write your life story. Will you be heroic or just someone trying to get by? Will you be the star or someone sitting on the end of the bench?<br> <br>I have no trouble with someone who strives to be the best and finishes in the middle of the pack. There&#x2019;s honor in that. I don&#x2019;t see that person as a failure. To the contrary, he will come to the end of his days with a smile on his face, because he spent the time and talent God gave him having a ball, finding out how good he could get. He will not be the person who goes to the grave thinking, &#x201c;If only I&#x2019;d been as talented as, say, LeBron James! My life would have been great!&#x201d;<br> <br>In fact, such a person doesn&#x2019;t have an inkling of the most important talent LeBron James has. Nor does he know he could have chosen to have that talent himself. I know, because I&#x2019;ve heard about it from the source.<br> <br>Some years ago, I got a call from Lance Blanks, who was then the assistant general manager of the NBA&#x2019;s Cleveland Cavaliers. I&#x2019;d known Lance since his days as a basketball player for the University of Virginia, where I taught and helped the athletic program as a sports psychologist. Lance wanted to know if I would spend a day talking with LeBron, then (and now again) the cornerstone of Cleveland&#x2019;s franchise. I was happy to say yes.<br> <br>I knew something about LeBron, of course. I knew the outer dimensions. He was six-eight, weighed two hundred fifty chiseled pounds, and had explosive speed. I knew he had been perhaps the most publicized high school basketball player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was known as Lew Alcindor. I knew he&#x2019;d been the NBA&#x2019;s number one draft choice the year he finished high school and I knew he&#x2019;d been a very successful professional for the Cavaliers. But until I had a chance to talk to him, I didn&#x2019;t know the most important thing about LeBron.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to be the greatest basketball player in history,&#x201d; he told me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;This is a truly talented guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was not that he had the physical gifts. It was LeBron&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been encountering his kind of attitude on occasion for more than three decades, and when I have encountered it, I&nbsp;have almost always had the pleasure of working with someone truly exceptional. One of my first clients in this category was someone who could hardly have been physically more different from LeBron, professional golfer Pat Bradley. Pat had average size and average clubhead speed; nothing about her initial appearance would suggest athletic ability to most people. And that was not even the most significant difference. LeBron had been a prodigy of whom much was expected from the time he was maybe fourteen years old. Pat had grown up in golfing obscurity. She was a girl from New England, which is not a cradle of golfers because of the short golf season up north. She hadn&#x2019;t gone to one of the colleges that traditionally has a strong women&#x2019;s golf team. LeBron would have disappointed a lot of people if he hadn&#x2019;t made himself into a great basketball player. Pat, had she been mediocre, would only have confirmed people&#x2019;s expectations. When I met her, she&#x2019;d been a professional golfer for eleven years, and she&#x2019;d won one tournament.<br> <br>I asked her about her dreams and goals.<br> <br>Almost diffidently, Pat said she wanted to win the LPGA Player of the Year award. She wanted to have the tour&#x2019;s lowest scoring average. She wanted to win all of the women&#x2019;s major championships. And she wanted to make the LPGA Hall of Fame. At the time, an LPGA player had to win thirty tournaments, including two majors, to be eligible for the Hall of Fame. It was the highest Hall of Fame hurdle in sports.<br> <br>She asked me if I thought she could do these things.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you can do them, but I&#x2019;m excited to work with someone who has your dreams.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the next ten years or so, Pat achieved all of those goals. So I certainly didn&#x2019;t discourage LeBron from thinking he could be the greatest. I just asked him where he thought he stood with regard to that goal.<br> <br>Sometimes, when I ask a client this kind of question, I&#x2019;ll get a response that indicates a troubled mind. A golfer might say that he&#x2019;s got the yips with his putter or his wedges. A singer might say she has stage fright. A businessperson might say that he&#x2019;s freezing up when he makes sales calls. Initially, LeBron&#x2019;s response was less about his mind than about his skills.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty darn good,&#x201d; LeBron said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not going to become the greatest basketball player in history if my teams don&#x2019;t win championships, and my teams aren&#x2019;t going to become champions if I don&#x2019;t become a better three-point shooter.&#x201d; (It tends to be forgotten now, but LeBron was not a finished player when he entered the NBA. He made only 29 percent of his three-point attempts in his rookie season.) &#x201c;Right now, when I get into the playoffs, other teams know that I can&#x2019;t make the three, so they won&#x2019;t even guard me. They just look at me and talk trash to me and say, &#x2018;Go ahead and take it. We know you can&#x2019;t make it and you know you can&#x2019;t make it.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t surprised to hear that opposing players would talk trash with LeBron, or that it would bother him. I&#x2019;ve worked with enough athletes to know that the godlike images we&#x2019;re fed by the media can often disguise reality. Superstars have doubts and fears just like the rest of us. So I nodded, and ï¿½LeBron went on.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve started to think a little bit on my threes,&#x201d; he acknowledged. &#x201c;You know, I have some doubt about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, I knew. In basketball, as in golf, as in almost any sport involving motor skills, an athlete gets the best results when he doesn&#x2019;t think. Once an athlete has learned a skill&#x2014;as ï¿½LeBron had learned to shoot a basketball&#x2014;he needs to trust that skill, focus on the target, and let the shot go without thinking about how to do it or being concerned about the result. In slightly more scientific terms, the subconscious areas of our minds do the best job of controlling motor skills. When the conscious brain gets involved, our bodies tend to become awkward. Doubt has a way of turning on that conscious brain, which is why confident shooters are better than shooters who lack confidence. A great deal of my work with athletes revolves around teaching them how to keep the conscious mind inactive or quiet when they&#x2019;re performing.<br> <br>It may surprise some readers to learn that the suggestions I&nbsp;gave to LeBron involved a lot more of what most people would perceive as plain hard work than they involved what most people would consider sports psychology.<br> <br>I did tell him that I thought he could benefit from one of the standard methods of sports psychology, visualization. I&nbsp;wanted him to see himself making three-point shots. I suggested that he ask the Cavaliers&#x2019; staff to make a highlight video for him, about eight to twelve minutes long. This video would be a LeBron James long-range shooting montage. It would have LeBron making threes off the dribble. It would show LeBron catching the ball and making threes spotting up. It could have some of LeBron&#x2019;s favorite music in the background, helping him to attach the good feelings associated with that music to the act of shooting threes. He would watch it every night. As he fell asleep, he could conjure up images of himself making three-point shots against tall, quick, tenacious defenders. He could let them fill his dreams.<br> <br>All of this would help him improve his three-point shooting, because it would feed the right sorts of images to his subconscious, helping him become a more trusting, confident shooter. But if improvement were as easy as watching videos, the NBA would have a lot more great three-point shooters. It isn&#x2019;t. The mental game is a big part of sport, but it must be combined with physical competence.<br> <br>So I suggested that LeBron hire a shooting coach and work with that coach every day. I told him he needed to make maybe two hundred three-point shots off the dribble every day, imagining the best defender in the league guarding him. I&nbsp;told him he needed to make another two hundred catch-and-shoot three-pointers. I told him I didn&#x2019;t care how many shots it took to make those four hundred three-pointers, or how long it took. If he wanted to be great, he would find the time and find the energy. The actual number of shots I suggested was not as important, in my mind, as the idea that LeBron would set a practice goal for himself, commit to achieving it every day, and wait patiently for results.<br> <br>I told him patience was essential because I had no way of predicting how long it would take to see improvement in his shooting statistics if he took my suggestions. But the patience and tenacity required were factors that could help him separate himself from his peers. A lot of athletes might undertake an improvement regimen like the one I suggested to LeBron. But not many would stick with it. After a few weeks, if they weren&#x2019;t seeing immediate results, they&#x2019;d find a reason to quit. Maybe they&#x2019;d decide the extra practice was wearing them down. Maybe they&#x2019;d decide that they just didn&#x2019;t have the talent to be a great outside shooter. They&#x2019;d find a way to talk themselves out of it. To encourage LeBron to persevere, I told him about my belief that great basketball shooters, like great golfers and great baseball hitters, are for the most part made rather than born.<br> <br>He and Pat Bradley had hard work in common. Pat didn&#x2019;t make it to the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame just because she wanted to. She used that desire to fuel hours and weeks and years of dedication and practice. Her dreams were her starting point.<br> <br>With LeBron, I also talked a lot about Bill Russell and Michael Jordan. Unlike golf, basketball is a team game. An essential part of being a great player is, in my mind, playing and conducting yourself in ways that make your teammates better. That, far more than scoring average, is the hallmark of a truly great player. Jordan and Russell were the players LeBron was chasing, because in addition to being great individually, they were players whose teams won many championships. They were great leaders. I suggested that LeBron read about Russell and Jordan and talk to them about leadership whenever he had the chance.<br> <br>I was very impressed with LeBron James. He was attentive. He asked insightful questions. It was clear that he was disciplined and that he set very high standards for himself. He was more than just a superstar. He was a very coachable athlete on a mission to see how great he could become. I gave him the suggestions I did because I knew that his desire to be the best would empower him. The way he chose to think about himself would drive him through the workouts, the visualization exercises, and all the other things he needed to do to improve. That&#x2019;s why the way he saw himself was his most important talent.<br> <br>I have noticed a few things since I spoke with LeBron. One is that his three-point shooting has improved dramatically. It&#x2019;s now roughly 40 percent, a one-third improvement over his rookie year. And I noticed, of course, that he switched teams, giving himself a better chance to win championships. And I&nbsp;have no doubt that the success LeBron has enjoyed is due to the kind of hard work we talked about that day, to his dedication to improvement, and to his strong commitment to team success.<br> <br>True superstars share his attitude. Not long after I worked with LeBron, I met with the University of Memphis basketball team, then coached by John Calipari and led on the floor by All-American Derrick Rose. I shared with the players how important I thought LeBron&#x2019;s attitude was in his success. A little while later, I got a call from Derrick. He had something he wanted to tell me. &#x201c;Doc, I want to be the greatest basketball player in history,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Derrick went on in 2011 to become the youngest MVP in the history of the NBA. He&#x2019;s suffered some devastating injuries in the last few years, and he&#x2019;s still working very hard to complete his rehabilitation from the subsequent knee surgeries. But if he does manage to heal fully, I&#x2019;d advise ï¿½LeBron and anyone else in the NBA to look out for him. Derrick, like ï¿½LeBron and Pat Bradley, has the champion&#x2019;s first ï¿½requirement&#x2014;the attitude he&#x2019;s chosen, the way he&#x2019;s decided to see himself.<br> <br>The vital importance of that sort of...</p><h2>Visions of a nomad</h2><p>, 224 pages, illustrated throughout with black and white photographs,</p><p></p><h2>I Love You, Miss Huddleston: And Other Inappropriate Longings of My Indiana Childhood</h2><p>In the vein of Bill Bryson&#x2019;s <em>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</em>, with a dash of some of the homegrown nostalgia of <em>The Dangerous Book for Boys</em> and <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>, humorist Philip Gulley (<em>Front Porch Tales, Home to Harmony</em>) tells of his coming of age in small-town Indiana.</p><p><p>With his ear for the small town and his knack for finding the needle of humor in life's haystack, Philip Gulley might well be Indiana's answer to Missouri's Mark Twain. In <em>I Love You, Miss Huddleston</em> we are transported to 1970's Danville, Indiana, the everyone-knows-your-business town where Gulley still lives today, to witness the uproarious story of Gulley's young life, including his infatuation with his comely sixth-grade teacher, his dalliance with sin&#x2014;eating meat on Friday and inappropriate activities with a mannequin named Ginger&#x2014;and his checkered start with organized religion.</p><blockquote><p>Sister Mary John had shown us a flannelgraph of the apostles receiving the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. They looked quite happy, except that their hair was on fire. . . . I was suspicious of a religion whose highpoint was the igniting of one's head, and my enthusiasm for church, which had never been great, began to fade.</p></blockquote><p>Even as Kennedy was facing down Khrushchev, Danny Millardo and his band of youthful thugs conducted a reign of terror still unmatched in the annals of Indiana history. With Gulley's sharp wit and keen observation, <em>I Love You, Miss Huddleston</em> captures these dramas and more, revisiting a childhood of unrelieved and happy chaos.</p><p>From beginning to end, Gulley recalls the hilarity (and heightened dangers) of those wonder years and the easy charm of midwestern life.</p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>.

Now hooks culminates her triumphant trilogy of love with <em>Communion: The Female Search for Love.</em></p><p>Intimate, revealing, provocative, Communion challenges every female to courageously claim the search for love as the heroic journey we must all choose to be truly free. In her trademark commanding and lucid language, hooks explores the ways ideas about women and love were changed by feminist movement, by women's full participation in the workforce, and by the culture of self-help. </p><p><em>Communion</em> is the heart-to-heart talk every woman -- mother, daughter, friend, and lover -- needs to have. </p></p><p><strong>Bell Hooks</strong> is a cultural critic, feminist theorist, and writer. Celebrated as one of our nation's leading public intellectual by <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, as well as one of <em>Utne Reader's</em> "100 Visionaries Who Could Change Your Life," she is a charismatic speaker who divides her time among teaching, writing, and lecturing around the world. Previously a professor in the English departments at Yale University and Oberlin College, hooks is the author of more than 17 books, including <strong>All About Love: New Visions</strong>; <strong>RememberedRapture: The Writer at Work</strong>; <strong>Wounds of Passion: A Writing Life</strong>; <strong>Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood</strong>; <strong>Killing Rage: Ending Racism</strong>; <strong>Art on My Mind: Visual Politics</strong>; and <strong>Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life</strong>. She lives in New York City.While feminism may have changed boardrooms, it didn't make much headway in bedrooms, argues philosopher/writer hooks. Women have made progress in regard to social empowerment, but the quest for emotional density for love has remained elusive. Why are men still so emotionally unsatisfying? Because, hooks argues, "patriarchal thinking has socialized males to believe that their manhood is affirmed when they are emotionally withholding." Patriarchy valorizes power and assigns it to men, and devalues nurturing and labels it feminine. Thus, young postfeminist women find themselves with "nothing to show" from their newly won equality but a double shift of work: first the paid job, then the physical and emotional homework of their relationship with their man. Still, as feminists of hooks's generation reach midlife, they may find it easier to rethink these terms of engagement, to risk changing things. The first step, she says, is self-love accepting one's body and soul just the way it is. Without such acceptance, women cannot escape the domination-submission dynamic. Even then, in this patriarchal universe finding love with another person may require some creativity. Hooks explores romantic friendships, lesbian loves and "circles of love" (which allow for committed bonds that extend beyond one partnership). A life with no coupling, but "a more authentic relationship between self and world," may also be satisfying. Twenty-something women who've embraced the highly problematic "bitch persona" Elizabeth Wurtzel has written of may sneer at hooks's affirming style, but older women, particularly those raising girls themselves, will find much to ponder here.

But some remained behind in Britain: Oliver Cromwell and a few companions, including the sharpshooter Julie Sims, her Scot husband Alex Mackay, and Cromwell&#x2019;s Irish-American self-appointed watchdog Darryl McCarthy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon, the hunt is on for the most notorious rebel in English history, with King Charles himself demanding Cromwell&#x2019;s head. The new chief minister Richard Boyle, Earl of Cork, brings over from Ireland a notorious crew of cutthroats led by the man called Finnegan to track down and capture the escapees from the Tower.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hunt passes through England and into Scotland, where the conflict between Cromwell and his companions and their would-be captors becomes embroiled in Scotland&#x2019;s politics, which are every bit as savage and ruthless as Finnegan and his men. To make things still more conflicted and confused, the time Darryl McCarthy spends fighting alongside Cromwell forces him against his will to admire and respect&#x2014;and even like&#x2014;the man, despite Cromwell&#x2019;s demonic reputation among all self-respecting Irish nationalist families like Darryl&#x2019;s own.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a Gordian knot anywhere you look&#x2014;until Julie Sims brings out her rifle.

Is it is because the blood-suckers are a perfect metaphor for corrupt politicians and corporate executives? Because alternative sexualities are gaining acceptance? Because the idea of living forever (even if undead) is so alluring? The reasons are unclear. What is clear is that the hottest subgenre (in both popularity and sensuality) is the vampire-huntress subgenre, thanks to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter and Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer. With L.A. Banks's debut novel, <i>Minion</i>, a tough, sexy new vampire huntress challenges the dominance of Anita Blake and Buffy.<p> Damali Richards is a rising star of Warriors of Light Records--but her fans would never guess that she is also the most important vampire hunter in a millennium. However, unfortunately for the inexperienced young huntress, the vampires and demons have both discovered her existence. An age-old war escalates to unprecedented heights of violence as the dark forces strive to slay Damali before she comes of age and gains her full powers.</p><p> Damali is an appealing heroine, the concept is intriguing, and the series is promising. However, the first novel is rocky. Damali is a vampire-killing martial artist, and <i>Minion</i> presents an epic struggle between good and evil, yet the novel neglects to include a climactic battle between Damali and the bad guys (or much of a climax at all; a sequel is obviously forthcoming). Another problem is that Damali's teacher withholds crucial information from not only the huntress, but also her guardians, who should have learned everything many years ago. In contrast, the characters frequently tell each other things they already know. Readers craving the twisted erotic charge of the Anita Blake novels or the Buffy-Spike relationship may be dissatisfied that sexual tension is less important to <i>Minion</i>; and readers seeking Hamiltonian melodrama may also be disappointed. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p><b><i>There is one woman who is all that stands between us and the eternal night.

With Charley, his French poodle, Steinbeck drives the interstates and the country roads, dines with truckers, encounters bears at Yellowstone and old friends in San Francisco. Along the way he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, the particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and the unexpected kindness of strangers.</p><p>In September 1960, John Steinbeck and his poodle, Charley, embarked on a journey across America. A picaresque tale, this chronicle of their trip meanders along scenic backroads and speeds along anonymous superhighways, moving from small towns to growing cities to glorious wilderness oases. Travels with Charley is animated by Steinbeck&#39;s attention to the specific details of the natural world and his sense of how the lives of people are intimately connected to the rhythms of nature - to weather, geography, the cycles of the seasons. His keen ear for the transactions among people is evident, too, as he records the interests and obsessions that preoccupy the Americans he encounters along the way.<b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929).<p>After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <b>In Dubious Battle</b> (1936), <b>Of Mice and Men</b> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1939). <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> won both the <b>National Book Award</b> and the <b>Pulitzer Prize</b> in 1939.</p><p>Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <b>The Forgotten Village</b> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <b>Sea of Cortez</b> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <b>The Moon is Down</b> (1942). <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945), <b>The Wayward Bus</b> (1948), another experimental drama, <b>Burning Bright</b> (1950), and <b>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</b> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <b>East of Eden</b> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <b>Sweet Thursday</b> (1954), <b>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</b> (1957), <b>Once There Was a War </b>(1958), <b>The Winter of Our Discontent </b>(1961), <b>Travels with Charley in Search of America </b>(1962), <b>America and Americans</b> (1966), and the posthumously published <b>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</b> (1969), <b>Viva Zapata!</b> (1975), <b>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</b> (1976), and <b>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1989).</p><p>Steinbeck received the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b> in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the <b>United States Medal of Freedom</b> by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.</p></p><h2>The Typewriter Is Holy: The Complete, Uncensored History of the Beat Generation</h2><p>2014 ACKER AWARD WINNER<br><br>Anyone who cares to understand the literary and cultural ferment of America in the later twentieth century must be familiar with the writings and lives of those scruffy bohemians known as the Beat Generation.<br><br>In this highly entertaining work, Bill Morgan, the country&#x2019;s leading authority on the movement and a man who personally knew most of the Beats, narrates the history of these writers as primarily a social group of friends, tracing their origins together during the World War II years to the full blossoming of their notoriety in the late 1950s to their profound influence on the social upheaval of the 1960s. Indeed, it is impossible to comprehend the sixties without first grasping the importance of the social ripples set in motion by the Beats a decade earlier.<br><br>Although their prose and poetry varied in style and for the most part did not represent a genuine literary movement, the Beats, through their words and nonconformist lives, collectively posed a challenge to the staid and complacent America of the postwar years. They believed in free expression, opposing all censorship; they dabbled in free love; they practiced Eastern philosophy, leading to an embrace in America of alternative forms of spirituality; sooner than others, they watched with dismay the increasingly heavy hand of military and corporate culture in our national life; they embraced the aspirations, as well as the lingo, of urbanized black Americans. They believed in the liberating influence of hallucinogenic drugs.<br><br>In short, the Beats were thoroughly American in their love of individual freedom. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that J. Edgar Hoover described them in 1960 as one of the three greatest threats to American security (after communism and intellectual "eggheads").<br><br>The story that Bill Morgan tells has less to do with sociology than with social mingling. He traces the closely knit friendships of the Beat luminaries Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and the small army of other names. Although Kerouac, author of the much loved novel <i>On the Road, </i>was the most famous of the Beat writers, it was Ginsberg, Morgan contends, who resided at the center of the group and for more than two decades provided it with cohesion and a sense of direction.<br><br>The Beats were not saints. They were sexually irresponsible, undependable in marriage (the movement could in fact fairly be described as misogynistic); they did too many drugs and consumed too much booze; the very quality that characterized their lives and writings&#x2014;a fervent belief in spontaneity&#x2014;destroyed some friendships. Indeed, Morgan&#x2019;s story begins with a murder in New York&#x2019;s Riverside Park in 1944.<br><br>Bill Morgan has provided a sweeping, indispensable story about these discontented free spirits. We watch their peripatetic lives, their sexual misadventures, their ambivalent response to fame. We are reminded above all that while their personal lives may have not have been holy, their typewriters and their lasting words very much were.</p><p><b>Bill Morgan </b>is the author and editor of more than a dozen books about the Beat writers, including the acclaimed biography, <i>I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg</i>. For nearly forty years he has worked as an editor and archival consultant for nearly every member of the Beat Generation including Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Diane Di Prima, Gregory Corso, William S. Burroughs, and Edie Kerouac. He lives in Vermont."<i>The Typewriter is Holy</i> is a wonderful romp, a totally engrossing history of the Beat generation, and those wildly colorful figures who brought about a seismic change in our culture. It makes sense of the intersecting lives of Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, William Burroughs and others whose great adventures gave birth to the upheavals of the Sixties. No one alive knows these people as well as Bill Morgan does, and the result is a fascinating chronicle.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Dinitia Smith, author of <i>The Illusionist</i> and <i>Remember This</i><br><br>&#x201c;At long last we have a first-rate history of the Beat Generation! Bill Morgan&#x2019;s <i>The Typewriter Is Holy</i> not only explores the enduring revolutionary appeal of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs but proudly brings marvelous lesser known Beat artists like Alan Ansen and Joanne Kyger into the Main Game mix. A masterful synthesis brimming with clarity and erudition&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Douglas Brinkley, Professor of History at Rice University and editor of <i>Windblown World: The Journals of Jack Kerouac, 1947-1954</i>.<br><br>"Bill Morgan draws on an encyclopedic knowledge of the Beat writers to shine sober, sympathetic light into the dark corners of four tortured lives. His painfully personal profiles of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and William Burroughs show how their misguided search for personal freedom trapped them in their own obsessions and addictions, yet also sparked an enlivening burst of creative genius."<br> -- Don Lattin, author of <i>The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America. </i></p><h2>Showdown: Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court Nomination That Changed America</h2><p>Thurgood Marshall brought down the separate-but-equal doctrine, integrated schools, and not only fought for human rights and human dignity but also made them impossible to deny in the courts and in the streets. In this stunning new biography, award-winning author Wil Haygood surpasses the emotional impact of his inspiring best seller <i>The Butler</i> to detail the life and career of one of the most transformative legal minds of the past one hundred years.<br><br> Using the framework of the dramatic, contentious five-day Senate hearing to confirm Marshall as the first African-American Supreme Court justice, Haygood creates a provocative and moving look at Marshall&#x2019;s life as well as the politicians, lawyers, activists, and others who shaped&#x2014;or desperately tried to stop&#x2014;the civil rights movement of the twentieth century: President Lyndon Johnson; Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr., whose scandals almost cost Marshall the Supreme Court judgeship; Harry and Harriette Moore, the Florida NAACP workers killed by the KKK; Justice J. Waties Waring, a racist lawyer from South Carolina, who, after being appointed to the federal court, became such a champion of civil rights that he was forced to flee the South; John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy; Senator Strom Thurmond, the renowned racist from South Carolina, who had a secret black mistress and child; North Carolina senator Sam Ervin, who tried to use his Constitutional expertise to block Marshall&#x2019;s appointment; Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who stated that segregation was &#x201c;the law of nature, the law of God&#x201d;; Arkansas senator John McClellan, who, as a boy, after Teddy Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House, wrote a prize-winning school essay proclaiming that Roosevelt had destroyed the integrity of the presidency; and so many others.<br><br> This galvanizing book makes clear that it is impossible to overestimate Thurgood Marshall&#x2019;s lasting influence on the racial politics of our nation.</p><p><b>WIL HAYGOOD</b>&nbsp;is currently the Wiepking Visiting Distinguished Professor in the department of media, journalism, and film at Miami University, Ohio. For nearly three decades he was a journalist, serving as a national and foreign correspondent at <i>The Boston Globe</i>, where he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and then at <i>The Washington Post</i>, where he wrote the story &#x201c;A Butler Well Served by this Election,&#x201d; which became the basis for the award-winning motion picture <i>The Butler</i>, directed by Lee Daniels. Haygood&#x2019;s book <i>The Butler: A Witness to History</i> has been translated into a dozen foreign languages. For his work on <i>Showdown</i>, Haygood was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship.

He was Senator John McClellan, and he was powerful, and people feared him. He had a hard ï¿½face&#x2014;ï¿½a dead ringer for the comic Jack Benny if Benny had been dipped in ï¿½plaster&#x2014;ï¿½and a hard, scratchy voice. He wore ï¿½horn-ï¿½rimmed glasses from which, time and again during previous hearings while sitting in judgment of others, he peered down on witnesses with menacing glares. He combed his hair straight back, in a severe manner. McClellan was one of the Senate ï¿½barons&#x2014;ï¿½men who had served for years and seemed to have grown out of the very building that housed the U.S. Senate. He loathed small talk and abhorred social teas and the like, which many senators and their wives seemed to enjoy. Even when his Arkansas constituents visited his Washington office, he seemed impatient, as if he wished they could state their business as fast as possible and be on their way. He&#x2019;d shoot an aide that look and then the aide would begin motioning ï¿½toward the door and McClellan would toss final words at his guests: thanks for coming by, say hi to the folks back home, don&#x2019;t forget to take a souvenir.<br><br>He had been sent to Washington by Arkansas voters, first as a congressman in 1934 and then, in 1942, as a U.S. senator. And now he found himself with a coveted seat on the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee. He told his aides to start digging. He wanted as much information on Thurgood Marshall as he could get, and he wanted it as fast as he could get it. John McClellan looked upon himself as a force for good, standing between Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court of the United States of America.<br><br>In Washington, McClellan prided himself on his activities, his constant motion. At one time, he sat on fourteen subcommittees. In 1954, he found himself on a committee with the Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy, who was galloping around the nation&#x2019;s capital on a ï¿½one-ï¿½man witch hunt for Communists. McCarthy had charged the State Department with having dozens of Communists in its employ. At a time when Americans were fearful of Communism, McCarthy&#x2019;s charges landed him on the front pages. Many were riled up. All of this intrigued McClellan, as ready as anyone to corral a Communist. But McCarthy, who was a shambling and reckless figure, soon made McClellan nervous. It was McCarthy&#x2019;s lack of discipline and some of his aides who were utterly unprofessional. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fond of Joe McCarthy,&#x201d; McClellan allowed, &#x201c;but he&#x2019;s getting out of hand, and we have to do something to control him.&#x201d; McClellan quit the ï¿½McCarthy-ï¿½led committee he was on. He escaped the shadow of McCarthy with prescient timing, as the ï¿½Army-ï¿½McCarthy hearings, nationally televised, exposed McCarthy as a ï¿½mean-ï¿½spirited liar. The Senate eventually censured him.<br><br>In 1957, McClellan led the celebrated Senate Labor Rackets Committee, which took on mobsters and their henchmen and eventually exposed the criminal underworld in America. That was the moment that John McClellan&#x2019;s profile rose in America. Because of disclosures exposed by his committee, two teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa and Dave Beck, had been sent to prison. Another round of hearings in 1963 offered up Joseph Valachi, a mobster who seemed to thrill television viewers with his insider&#x2019;s account of ï¿½cold-ï¿½blooded doings in the Mafia. The Omaha ï¿½World-ï¿½Herald had once said of McClellan that he possessed a &#x201c;steely mask of Old Testament righteousness.&#x201d; If John McClellan had stopped gangsters, he figured he could certainly thwart LBJ&#x2019;s new Supreme Court nominee.<br><br>In Washington, they ï¿½didn&#x2019;t bother to refer to him as Senator McClellan; they called him &#x201c;the Chairman,&#x201d; because he had been chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, as well as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, which was the committee that provided him with the tools to go after the mobsters. Because those racketeering hearings were nationally televised, everyone knew Senator John McClellan. The young aides in the Johnson White House knew well how dangerous McClellan could be to their efforts in getting Thurgood Marshall onto the U.S. Supreme Court. &#x201c;Virtually every speech he made inscribed a rising curve from the prudent statement of fact to polemical rage, his powerful voice quavering with indignation,&#x201d; is how the Johnson aide Harry McPherson put it.<br><br>The Johnson administration had drawn a battle line. Thurgood Marshall was the lawyer who had won the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, a ruling that led to utter embarrassment in McClellan&#x2019;s home state in the fall of 1957, when nine Negro schoolchildren had tried to desegregate Little Rock Central High School and been stopped by whites hurling epithets, spit, and large rocks. (It was also the year that Time magazine named McClellan its Man of the Year.) Reporters on the scene to cover the story were chased and bloodied by the mobs. This had forced President Dwight Eisenhower to go into military mode and dispatch troops to protect the children. The troops had to remain at the school watching over the Negro children for an entire year. Little Rock was thus seared into the nation&#x2019;s psyche as mean and bigoted. And on his trips back home to Arkansas at the time, to attend all those social events and grand openings and visit family as all politicians do, John McClellan had to endure all the chatter about Little Rock, about how the government was attacking states&#x2019; rights, how Negroes were trying to take over the schools. And all he could do was assure his constituents that he was doing everything he could to protect their way of life, the southern way of life. It made McClellan angry, though, how he had to take up all of this time defending himself and how hard he was working in Washington to keep Arkansas as it had always been. Thurgood Marshall, if he made it to the Supreme Court, was not going to keep Arkansas as it had always been.<br><br>But first, before McClellan could do anything about Marshall, he had to clear his throat. He did not like it one bit that President Johnson had stunned him with the suddenness of the Marshall nomination. After all, he was a southern Democrat like Johnson himself! John McClellan so prided himself on having the pulse of government, of government at the highest levels, of what they were doing over at the White House, that this series of ï¿½events&#x2014;ï¿½a justice departing, then, in a flash, a new ï¿½nomination&#x2014;ï¿½only gnawed at his sense of propriety and even decorum. McClellan ï¿½couldn&#x2019;t figure out how all of this had transpired, had been put into motion without any hints falling his way. And he did not like any of it at all.<br><br>it was often said around the Johnson White House that what LBJ wanted, LBJ got. And in the summer of 1967, LBJ wanted to put Thurgood Marshall, a Negro, on the Supreme Court. There was a small problem: there was no vacancy nor had a single sitting justice been talking about stepping down from his lifetime appointment. Johnson looked to his Texas roots and saw clearly how he could solve the problem.<br><br>Lyndon Johnson had first met the associate justice Tom Clark back in Texas in 1938, when Johnson was a young congressman. The Johnson and Clark families went on outings together, their little children romping across wide lawns. &#x201c;A friendship developed that included the whole family; it was much more than a professional relationship between the two men,&#x201d; Tom Clark&#x2019;s daughter, Mimi Clark Gronlund, would recall. When Johnson&#x2019;s daughters, Lynda and Luci, became engaged, the Clarks threw parties for them. (There was something interesting about Texas men who had more amenable attitudes ï¿½toward Negroes than others in the state. &#x201c;I knew him when he first came to Washington,&#x201d; Thurgood Marshall would come to recall of Tom Clark. &#x201c;I knew his mother. And his brother in Dallas . . . His mother, way ï¿½back&#x2014;ï¿½this will go back to the late ï¿½thirties&#x2014;ï¿½her housekeeper, a Negro, ate dinner with her. They ate right at the same table together. Now, back in the thirties, you ï¿½didn&#x2019;t do that in Texas.&#x201d;) Clark had originally been encouraged to come to Washington in 1937 by the House majority leader, Sam Rayburn, who was Johnson&#x2019;s mentor. Clark joined the Justice Department as a special assistant. After the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, President Truman appointed Clark attorney general. And when the Supreme Court justice Frank Murphy died in 1949, Truman nominated Clark to the court. Court openings were created, often, by grave and declining health, or death. But in 1967, as Justice Clark&#x2019;s family knew, he was in good health and had not at all talked of resigning from the court. In order to nominate Marshall, Johnson had to make some fast ï¿½chess-ï¿½like moves.<br><br>First, Johnson encouraged Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to resign, then appointed Katzenbach undersecretary of state. Johnson intended to appoint Ramsey ï¿½Clark&#x2014;ï¿½the deputy attorney general, who happened to be Tom Clark&#x2019;s ï¿½son&#x2014;ï¿½to the position permanently. But Johnson knew ï¿½others&#x2014;ï¿½inside the legal profession and ï¿½out&#x2014;ï¿½would wonder about a perceived conflict of interest because Clark&#x2019;s father sat on the high court. But Lyndon Johnson knew people; he knew the dynamics of fathers and sons, how a rising son could make a father swoon with pride, and how a father, if called upon to make a sacrifice for his one and only son, might do it almost as reflex, without giving it a second thought. &#x201c;He talked to Tom Clark to tell him he wanted to appoint Ramsey attorney general,&#x201d; Johnson&#x2019;s aide Joseph Califano would recall. &#x201c;Johnson needed a vacancy to put Thurgood Marshall on the court. So Tom Clark had to retire, and Johnson got the vacancy.&#x201d; Decades later, recalling the Johnson maneuverings, Califano could still beam with amazement: &#x201c;It was a classic Johnson move.&#x201d;<br><br>So grateful was Johnson for Tom Clark&#x2019;s resignation that he sent Clark and his wife on a ï¿½once-ï¿½in-ï¿½a-ï¿½lifetime trip around the world. Ostensibly, it was a goodwill mission sponsored by the Department of State with Clark expected to exchange ideas with foreign officials about their respective judiciaries, but it ï¿½really was a gift to the Clarks for Tom Clark&#x2019;s stepping down. The couple set foot in more than a dozen exotic locales, among them Honk Kong, New Zealand, Jordan, Indonesia, Greece, Turkey, Tokyo, and finally ï¿½Rome&#x2014;ï¿½where they dined in style and saw the ruins. Mrs. Clark called it their &#x201c;great adventure.&#x201d;<br><br>The Johnson White House aimed to use surprise as a weapon in its strategic rollout of the ï¿½Clark-ï¿½Marshall announcements. And it worked, because some of the Senate Judiciary Committee ï¿½members&#x2014;ï¿½especially the ï¿½southerners&#x2014;ï¿½complained bitterly about the swiftness of the move, which had caught them off guard. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d just call Senator Eastland, Senator Thurmond, and say, &#x2018;Senator, I&#x2019;m nominating Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court,&#x2019; and before they could say anything,&#x201d; says Califano, &#x201c;he&#x2019;d hang the phone up and call the next senator.&#x201d; McClellan, James Eastland, Strom Thurmond, and all the other Judiciary Committee members were treated with similarly fast phone calls.<br><br>The Marshall announcement unleashed waves of pride within the Johnson White House, a pride that bubbled especially among Negroes nationwide.<br><br>The White House, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, had a peculiar and vexing relationship with blacks throughout history. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt had the ï¿½educator&#x2014;ï¿½and onetime ï¿½slave&#x2014;ï¿½Booker T. Washington to the White House to dine. The engagement was private, unannounced. But word quickly seeped out. The southern newspapers let the epithets fly: &#x201c;Roosevelt Dines a Darkey.&#x201d; &#x201c;A Rank Negrophilist.&#x201d; &#x201c;Our ï¿½Coon-ï¿½Flavored President.&#x201d; &#x201c;Roosevelt Proposes to Coddle the Son of Ham.&#x201d; &#x201c;At one stroke, and by one act,&#x201d; The Richmond News opined of Teddy Roosevelt, &#x201c;he has destroyed the kindly, warm regard and personal affection for him which were growing up fast in the South. Hereafter . . . it will be impossible to feel, as we were beginning to feel, that he is one of us.&#x201d; Not many years later, in 1915, the D. W. Griffith movie The Birth of a Nation opened in theaters. It was based on Thomas Dixon&#x2019;s novel The Clansman, a vile piece of fiction that painted blacks with evil stereotypes. They were thieves and sexual marauders lusting after white women. The NAACP condemned the movie, but not President Woodrow Wilson, who hosted a screening at the White House, then heaped praise on the movie. Wilson also went on to segregate the federal workforce in the nation&#x2019;s capital. A Negro was not appointed to an executive White House position until President Eisenhower&#x2019;s first term, and even that move was fraught with pain. E. Frederic ï¿½Morrow&#x2014;ï¿½a Bowdoin College grad, a CBS public relations executive, a man of steely resolve and great ï¿½dignity&#x2014;ï¿½had done campaign work for the candidate Eisenhower. Members of Eisenhower&#x2019;s team were so impressed with his work they promised a White House position. When Ike won, Morrow&#x2019;s phone did not ring. He complained. He was finally given a job at the Commerce Department. But it did not sit well with him; he had been promised a White House position. Republican allies of Morrow&#x2019;s in New York City put pressure on the White House to deliver on its promise, and Morrow finally became a White House staff member in 1955.<br><br>Little wonder Negro newspapers around the nation proudly trumpeted the Marshall nomination.<br><br>But with pride aside, the Johnson White House knew the first stop was the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was a historic committee and one of the original standing committees in the Senate, first authorized in 1816. Throughout its history, the committee took on a wide range of assignments, from bankruptcies, to state boundaries, to contested Senate elections. The committee even played a role in the aftermath of Reconstruction, settling matters when it came to Confederate states and their restoration to the Union. It had long been a committee steeped in thorny challenges and national urgency. &#x201c;There was clear knowledge that there would be a fight,&#x201d; remembers the Johnson aide Clifford Alexander. &#x201c;Johnson knew because he came out of the leadership of the Senate. It was key to get the nomination out of the Judiciary Committee. The Democrats were the segregationists.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Art of Star Wars, Episode IV - A New Hope</h2><p>To compliment the new Special Edition versions of the classic Star Wars films being released in theaters, these new editions of the bestselling companion books each include sixteen pages of all-new material, plus all of the breathtaking photos, and artwork that have made them a must for all Star Wars collectors and movie buffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete scripts for <b>A New Hope</b> and <b>Return of the Jedi</b> are also included.<br><br><b>Some highlights of the three volumes:</b><br><br>Storyboards of action sequences detailing the evolution of the story and characters<br>Spectacular US and foreign movie posters<br>Costume sketches<br>Design and animation techniques used for the immense Imperial Walkers<br>The evolution of Yoda<br>Model construction of the new Death Star<br>Blueprints and sketches of the Imperial shuttle design<br>Rebel and Imperial vehicles<br>And much more!</p><p>A NEW HOPE was part of the original title of the movie that became STAR WARS, the ultimate movie entertainment experience of the 1970s that lives on as one of the most-loved movies of all time.

Feasts have been used to celebrate significant occasions, to parade rank and hierarchy, and to flatter and influence people. There has always been a theatrical element to the feast as well-from the nude dancers who entertained dinner guests in ancient Greece to the restrained rigors of the Victorian dinner party.<br> Sir Roy Strong examines this cultural phenomenon with knowledge, wit, and style-beginning with the ninth century B.C., when a Babylonian emperor discreetly invited seventy thousand guests for a ten-day celebration, and ending early in the twentieth century, by which time feasts had become somewhat more modest. Always attuned to how these celebrations mirror the societies that hold them and to the way they reflect shifts in power and class, this beautifully illustrated book offers a lively and illuminating history of grand eating.<br>.<br></p><p>What occurs when we gather to dine? More than just eating, says Roy Strong, whose remarkable <i>Feast: A History of Grand Eating</i>reviews sumptuous dining from ancient Greece to the present. What is discovered, again and again, is that "the meal, and everything connected with it has been, and still is, a vehicle for determining status and hierarchy--and also aspiration--no matter what pattern of society prevails." To illustrate, Strong takes readers on a journey that encompasses the banquets of ancient Rome, which, preceding their decadent excesses (Caligula liked dinner with decapitations), were models of civilized entertainment; to the Christian and Renaissance eras, a transformation of dining from symbolic ecclesiastical ritual to splendorous high-court ceremony; to a newly hierarchical world which, in counter-distinction to French Revolution commonalties, yielded the 19th and early 20th-century's defining status event, the dinner party; and finally to our own dispiriting time, in which the erosion of traditional forms has left us with TV-snacking, grazing, and the restaurant as surrogate rank-delineator, once society's task.<p> Strong is a master distiller who keeps a sharp academic lookout while proving a companionable, entertaining guide. It's hard to imagine anyone who could more pithily explore, for example, the evolution and meaning of manners (from courtly ritual to aspiring-class impediment); the invention of the dining room (which required a permanent dining table, long in coming); sugar's pivotal role (as a baroque sculptural medium!); and the history of cookbooks (keen mirrors of class). For anyone interested in what it has meant to use a fork (first a status marker then, supplanting the knife, the only approved implement for carrying food to mouth) among much else, this is a perfect read. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i><i></i></p>A unique and fascinating history of grand eating by one of the UK?s best-known communicators. <br> <br>Sharing a meal, in particular a grand one, has always been a complex social mechanism for uniting and dividing people. Such an event could signal peace, a marriage, a victory, an alliance, a coming-of-age, a coronation or a funeral. The feast was a vehicle for display and ostentation, for the parade of rank and hierarchy, for flattering and influencing people as well as providing a theatre in which to exercise the art of conversation and the display of manners. <br> <br>In an age that has virtually abolished the shared meal as a central feature of daily living, Feast presents a revelatory <br>picture of a world we have lost. Beautifully illustrated, it traces fashions in food and the etiquette of eating -- from the elegance of the Roman villa to the austerity of the monastic refectory, from the splendours of the Renaissance banquet to the rigours of the Victorian dinner party.</p><h2>Film History An Introduction</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260084856 is an International Student Edition of Film History: An Introduction 4th Edition by Kristin Thompson and David Bordwell This ISBN 9781260084856 is Textbook only.

In this fastpaced, revelatory book, Superman begins his ascension to iconic hero as he leaves Smallville and becomes Metropolis&#39;s revered protector and guardian. Featuring the Man of Steel&#39;s legendary first encounters with Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, and Batman, this amazing book also includes a deadly battle with Bizarro, a fateful encounter with Lana Lang, and Superman&#39;s astonishing discovery of his Kryptonian heritage.</p><p>Born in England and raised in Canada, John Byrne discovered super-heroes through&#34; The&#34; &#34;Adventures of Superman&#34; on television. After studying at the Alberta College of Art and Design, he broke into comics first with Skywald and then at Charlton, where he created the character Rog-2000. Following his tenure at Charlton, Byrne moved to Marvel, where his acclaimed runs on &#34;The Uncanny X-Men&#34; and &#34;The Fantastic Four&#34; soon made him one of the most popular artists in the industry. In 1986 he came to DC to revamp Superman from the ground up, and since then he has gone on to draw and/or write every major character at both DC and Marvel. A veteran of more than five decades in the comic-book field, Dick Giordano began his career as an artist for Charlton Comics in 1952 and became the company s editor-in-chief in 1965, launching the short-lived but well-remembered Action Heroes line. In 1967 he moved to DC for a three-year stint as editor and became part of a creative team that helped to change the face of comic books in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Together with writer Dennis O Neil and penciller Neal Adams, he helped to bring Batman back to his roots as a dark, brooding creature of the night and raise awareness of contemporary social issues through the adventures of Green Lantern and Green Arrow. The winner of numerous industry awards, Giordano later returned to DC and rose to the position of Vice President-Executive Editor before retiring in 1993 to once again pursue a full-time freelance career as a penciller and inker. He passed away on March 27, 2010.&#34;</p><h2>King of the Jews</h2><p><p>So begins <strong>Nick Tosches</strong>'s sprawling biography of Arnold Rothstein, which, in fact, is so much more: not only an elegy to old New York but an idiosyncratic history of the world as told in Nick Tosches's inimitable style.</p><p>Known by many names -- A. R., Mr. Big, The Fixer, The Big Bankroll, The Man Uptown, and The Brain -- Rothstein seemed more myth than man. He was gambling, and he was money. The inspiration for Meyer Wolfsheim in <strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> and Nathan Detroit in <em>Guys and Dolls</em>, he was rumored to be the mastermind of the Black Sox scandal, the fixing of the 1919 World Series. He was Mr. Broadway and had his own booth at Lindy's Restaurant in Manhattan, where he held court.</p><p>Now, in <strong>King of the Jews</strong>, Nick Tosches, "one of the greatest living American writers" (<em>Dallas Observer</em>), examines Rothstein's extraordinary legacy by placing him at the center of nothing less than the history of the entire Western world.</p></p><p><p>Nick Tosches is the acclaimed author of many books, including biographies of Jerry Lee Lewis, Dean Martin, and Sonny Liston. He writes for numerous periodicals, including <em>Vanity Fair</em>, where he is a contributing editor. He lives in New York City.</p>Readers who make it to the end of this unusual book may already have asked themselves the author's closing questions: "Why am I writing this, and why are you reading it?" Those cracking the binding in hopes of encountering a new biography of mobster Arnold "the Brain" Rothstein, rumored to be the fixer behind the 1919 World Series scandal, will do some mental scratching at the lengthy introductory discourses on the etymology of "dice" and the Torah's variant names for God. Tosches is attempting to use the figure of the Tammany Hall&#x2013;era gangster as an entry point for an idiosyncratic, wide-ranging history of Western civilization. Rothstein himself really doesn't appear until two-thirds of the way into the book (although earlier chapters about religion, fascism, political correctness and other subjects of interest to the author alternate with excerpts on the criminal from an old Brooklyn newspaper and from surrogate's court proceedings). This despite Tosches's representations&#x2014;unsupported, alas&#x2014;that the gangster deserves further study and attention "[b]ecause Arnold Rothstein is a shadow figure beyond good and evil." But by giving short shrift to the details of the endemic corruption plaguing New York City during Rothstein's reign, the author fails to make his case that misconduct by police and elected officials was at least as reprehensible. <i>Agent, Russ Galen.</i><i>(May 3)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The last time we met I had been accompanied by a friend, a lawyer who knew his way around the Archives. Then, Dr. Kutrucz had been all business: crisp, impersonal, bureaucratic. An oldstyle apparatchik, I had assumed, simply allowing me to see -- as was my right under the laws of post-Communist Hungary -- the secret police files on my parents. Now her voice sounded different -- more human, more compassionate. Her new tone made me anxious. </p><p> Just a short while earlier, one of Hungary's most respected writers had been given his father's files -- and discovered a history of breathtaking intrigue and betrayal even of his family. The foremost historian of the AVO, the Hungarian secret police, had warned me that I was "opening a Pandora's box," when I first applied for access to the files. But I wanted to know the truth about my parents, about what had really happened in Budapest, in those distant Cold War days, when my sister and I were children. My parents had glossed over large portions of our history -- even though my father was a celebrated journalist of his era, who won awards and recognition for his coverage of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. "You are an American," Papa would say, "you cannot ever understand what it was like under the Fascists and the Communists." </p><p> That night I slept fitfully. What did I fear most? I suppose evidence of some act of compromise or betrayal that would shatter forever my image of my parents. The risk was real. From Gï¿½nter Grass to Milan Kundera, secret police files from the Gestapo to the KGB continue to disgorge the debris of half a century of such betrayals. I understand why so many people do not want to learn about the past; let sleeping dogs lie, they say to me. But I want the truth, even if it is painful. </p><p> Eyes burning from a sleepless night spent wondering about the archivist's changed tone, I climb the grand staircase of an Italian Renaissance palazzo, the birthplace, in 1946, of the AVO. The building had been the scene of some of the terror state's worst crimes. By 1950, the palazzo couldn't contain the work of thousands of uniformed and nonuniformed agents and their vast network of informers whose job it was to infiltrate every corner of their fellow citizens' lives. So the AVO requisitioned other choice bits of real estate on and around the elegant Andrassy Boulevard, which had been renamed Stalin Boulevard. Today, the building flies the European Union's blue and gold banner and shares the block with two health spas. </p><p> Dr. Katalin Kutrucz, a short, high-strung, bustling woman in a synthetic pants suit and wearing sort of open-toed Dr. Scholl's shoes with socks, ushers me into an oval-shaped room with high ceiling and intricate molding -- a room that seems suitable for an intimate musical evening. She plunks down next to me at a faux wood table. Blinking fast, she says, "It turns out that yours is one of our bigger files." Should I feel proud? I am terrified and eager to plunge into a growing mountain of manila files that clerks in white coats are wheeling in on shopping carts and unloading. Dr. Kutrucz does not smile, but the fact that she calls me Katika, the Hungarian diminutive of my name, only increases my agitation. </p><p> All my life, my parents' defiance of the Communists, their stubborn courage as the last independent journalists behind the Iron Curtain until their arrest, trial, and conviction as CIA spies, has been at the core of our family identity. On February 25, 1955, at two in the morning, following a game of bridge at the home of the United States military attachï¿½, my father was abducted by six agents of the secret police. His arrest was front-page news in <i>The New York Times</i>. Four months later, they came for my mother. The following January, almost a year later, <i>The New York Times</i>, in another front-page story, reported that "Endre Marton, a correspondent for the Associated Press in communist ruled Hungary, has been sentenced to six years in prison on a charge of espionage. His wife, Ilona, who worked for United Press was sentenced to three years...The Martons have two young daughters, Kati and Juli." Accompanying the article was a photograph of a handsome, elegant couple and their smiling little girls, a happy family, self-contained and seemingly indestructible, on our last Christmas together in Hungary, before everything changed. Thus did I make my debut in the press, although I did not see the story until decades later. </p><p> My parents were forward-looking people. They looked back only selectively. When, toward the end of his life, my father was given Hungary's highest civilian award from the foreign minister of a free and democratic Hungary, he did not come to New York to receive it in person, leaving it to me to accept for him. That evening, the foreign minister surprised me with a large manila envelope containing AVO material on Papa. My father never opened that file; he was done with all that. To him, history -- at least his history -- was a burden. For me, it was the beginning of my search. </p><p> It has been said that childhood is a foreign land. This is especially so if the child is uprooted early from that small universe where all is familiar, and transplanted to a country where no one knows how to pronounce her name. After my parents both died -- my mother in 2004 and my father the following year -- I became obsessed with learning everything I could about what precisely had happened to them and to my sister and me in the land where everything began. No subsequent chapter in my life had matched those Budapest years for intensity and the power of family love. My parents and sister and I formed a tight unit partly because the world outside was hostile. Once safe in America, each of us would pursue our own lives, and our family ties inevitably loosened. We had successfully made the crossing. Strangely, I still longed for a time that had been dangerous and painful for all of us -- yet had bound us together. I missed the closeness of our lives in Budapest. </p><p> A child growing up in a State built on terror learns early that she, and even her parents, is nothing compared to the power of that State. However accomplished or witty or glamorous the parents -- and mine were all of those things -- they were playthings in the hands of the State. In such a place a child has no rights, not even the right to her parents. So when they were taken from me -- and this is how it seemed to a child, they were <i>taken from me</i> -- a separation marked me, not just them, and forever. I wanted to open the files in order to put that trauma to rest. </p><p> There was something else that puzzled me as the files disgorged secrets. Why did my parents take such risks? During the Cold War, most Hungarians would cross a street rather than risk being seen greeting an American. But my parents' best friends were American diplomats and journalists. What every grown-up I knew whispered, my parents spoke out loud. At a time when there were roughly two thousand private cars in all of Hungary, our family drove a white Studebaker convertible! We might as well have ridden a rocket. </p><p> So, when some years later I, too, received the same award from the Hungarian government as my father, I returned to Budapest, to this stately house of horrors, and filled out all the requisite forms. For several months I waited in New York to be summoned by the head of these archives, Katalin Kutrucz. </p><p> Periodically moistening her finger, Katalin, as I am now encouraged to call her, flips through the hundreds of pages of our family file. She is familiar with their contents. As the pages fly by, names from my childhood unspool. Even more names are inside quotation marks, code names for informers. Reading my thoughts, Katalin says, "Everybody in your circle, whether your parents trusted or did not trust them, was informing on them. That was just the way it was." She shrugs. Flipping through a series of reports under code name "Gaspar," I am struck by the frequency of my name and my sister, Julia's. I do not want to risk losing these pages amid the thousands, so I place a hand on hers. "Please." She pauses for a moment. "These are all yours. You can take them and do what you like with them." As if to say, "We are a different country now!" But I can't wait. Who is this energetic informer "Gaspar" and why her constant reference to two little girls? "Well," Katalin answers, pursing her lips, "I am not allowed to inform you of such things, the actual names of agents. But I will tell you this: the code usually has some connection to the real name." Gaspar. Of course. Gabrielle. Our French nanny! A zealous agent, to judge by her contribution to the file. Along with anger I feel some vindication. I never liked her, and it was mutual. I can still hear the clop, clop, of her high heels every morning as she reached for the venetian blinds directly over my head, raising them with maximum clatter, while calling out in her shrill high-pitched voice, <i>"Levez-vous, mes enfants!"</i> No wonder she was always in a hurry. She had more important business. </p><p> Out of another file falls artwork by my sister and me: a house with a smoking chimney, and birds the size of people strolling in the foreground, and another with a long row of snails climbing a hill, with the inscription, "Mamikanak," "To Mommy." Another stick figure drawing is inscribed with handwriting I recognize as my grandmother's. "Kati did this and she isn't even in school yet!" And, more chillingly, shots of my parents, clearly caught unawares on a street, by a telephoto lens. I am struck that, even though oblivious to the camera's intrusive eye, my father is ramrod straight, his face composed, his expression inscrutable. A man who, having barely survived the Nazis, was caught again on the losing side, wearing protective armor against the outside world. But no armor could protect him from a State that collected his children's artwork. </p><p> But now my guide is speed...</p></p><h2>Cherokee Feast of Days, Volume II</h2><p>Beloved Cherokee inspirational writer Joyce Sequichie Hifler offers another volume of daily meditations based on her Native American heritage.</p><p>Joyce Sequichie Hifler offers this beloved collection of daily meditation books drawn from her own rich Cherokee heritage and that of other tribes.

As they do the things we all do&#x2015;bum a cigarette at a party, stroll with a girlfriend down Madison Avenue, take a kid to the zoo&#x2015;they're confronted with their own uncooperative selves. These artists, writers, lawyers, teachers, and actors make fools of themselves, spiral out of control, have delusions of grandeur, despair, and find it hard to imagine a future. They talk, they listen, they hope, they dream. They look for communion in a city, both beautiful and menacing, which can promise so much and yield so little. But they are hungry for life. They want to love and be loved.<br> These stories, all published in <i>The New Yorker</i> over the last fifteen years, make it clear that Antrim is one of America's most important writers. His work has been praised by his significant contemporaries, including Jonathan Franzen, Thomas Pynchon, Jeffrey Eugenides, and George Saunders, who described <i>The Verificationist</i> as "one of the most pleasure-giving, funny, perverse, complicated, addictive novels of the last twenty years." And here is Antrim's best book yet: the story collection that reveals him as a master of the form.</p></p><p><p>Donald Antrim is the author of the novels <i>Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World</i>, <i>The Hundred Brothers</i>, and <i>The Verificationist</i>, as well as a memoir, <i>The Afterlife</i>. He is a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and an associate professor in the writing program at Columbia University. He is a 2013 MacArthur Fellow.</p><p><i>AN ACTOR PREPARES</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee Strasberg, a founder of the Group Theatre and the great teacher of the American Method, famously advised his students never to &#x201c;use&#x201d;&#x2014;for generating tears, etc., in a dramatic scene&#x2014;personal/historical material less than seven years in the personal/historical past; otherwise, the Emotion Memory (the death of a loved one or some like event in the actor&#x2019;s life that can, when evoked through recall and substitution, hurl open the floodgates, as they say, right on cue, night after night, even during a long run)&#x2014;this material, being <i>too close</i>, as it were, might overwhelm the artist and compromise the total control required to act the part or, more to the point, act it well; might, in fact, destabilize the play; if, for instance, at the moment in a scene when it becomes necessary for Nina or Gertrude or Macduff to wipe away tears and get on with life; if, at that moment, it becomes impossible for a wailing performer to pull it together; if, in other words, the <i>performer</i> remains trapped in affect long after the <i>character</i> has moved on to dinner or the battlefield&#x2014;when this happens, then you can be sure that delirious theatrical mayhem will follow.</p> <p>What is the point in all this? Strasberg was wrong. Seven years are not enough, a fact I discovered recently during a twilight performance of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, presented on the college green to commemorate the founding, a hundred and fifty years ago, by the Reverend William Trevor Barry&#x2014;my great-great-grandfather on my father&#x2019;s side&#x2014;of the small liberal-arts institution that bears our family&#x2019;s name and our seal. I am Reginald Barry, Dean of Student Life and Wm. T. Barry Professor of Speech and Drama at Barry College, so naturally it fell to me to direct our commemorative, barefoot production of Shakespeare&#x2019;s great festive comedy. While I was at it, I decided to serve up some ham myself, as Lysander. What would a skinny, balding, unmarried, childless forty-six-year-old Lysander&#x2014;a PhD with hair on his back&#x2014;<i>mean</i> within the context of an otherwise college-age show? I&#x2019;m not sure I can answer that question. Normally, Lysander would be essayed by some good-looking lacrosse goalie waiting his turn to date-rape the beautiful, waifish Mary Victoria Frost, our Hermia, only a sophomore herself and already the finest actress we&#x2019;ve had in my time at Barry, a sure candidate for Yale, or Juilliard if she can ease off the drugs. I might stand in as Egeus or Theseus, or maybe Oberon, King of the Faeries, if I felt up to it. But high-concept casting is a director&#x2019;s prerogative. Two seasons ago, we mounted an all-male, all-nude <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>. People said it increased their appreciation for the radical potentials in Elizabethan drama.</p> <p>And so, the play. Four adolescents turned out by law and their parents into a green world governed by spooks, all playing&#x2014;children and their phantoms&#x2014;at love and nighttime evil.</p> <p>The adolescents were me, Mary Victoria Frost, Sheila Tannenbaum, as Helena, and Billy Valentine, as Demetrius. Sheila, a junior, plays character parts when she&#x2019;s not playing basketball for the Lady Bears, and I knew she&#x2019;d make an acceptable if not entirely agreeable Helena, with her big hands and lurching walk and brown eyes too far apart on an otherwise bent-looking, asymmetrical face; but Valentine represented a casting risk. Valentine is a certain kind of blond-haired, upper-middle-class boy&#x2014;the type is familiar at any private school in the land, I would imagine&#x2014;a sarcastic, wiry little underachiever who, on the basis of no evidence, is rumored among his peers to be a genius.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come to rehearsals stoned, Billy,&#x201d; I warned this kid before first read-through.</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Stoned</i>, Mr. Barry?&#x201d; He laughed. The previous Friday, a bunch of us had found ourselves lying around on sofas in my office in Lower Hancock, getting wasted on some of Billy&#x2019;s very strong homegrown.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to work,&#x201d; I told him now, and he said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I should be playing Puck?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You want to direct this show, Valentine?&#x201d; I asked him. &#x201c;No? Then let me worry about casting.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, Mr. Barry. Everything&#x2019;s cool. It&#x2019;s just that Martin can&#x2019;t read his script. I mean, he can&#x2019;t <i>see</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>Billy Valentine had a point. Putting Martin Epps in as Puck was like putting, well, I don&#x2019;t know what into what. How can you defend a totally blind Robin Goodfellow tapping his way around the stage with a telescoping cane, except in theory?</p> <p>Dramaturgically speaking, the theory was sound enough, I thought; and so I opened up rehearsals by reciting it&#x2014;in somewhat oblique form&#x2014;to my cast. There they were, the &#x201c;drama mafia,&#x201d; down in the windowless Hancock Hall basement, twenty-five or thirty hungover Lovers, Royals, Spirit Wraiths, Merry Men, stagehands, set techies, and walk-ons, all dressed in late-spring cutoffs and oxford-cloth shirts and sheer halter tops, almost every one of this lot&#x2014;except Martin Epps, the blind boy&#x2014;inhaling drags off cigarettes; it was a bored, blasï¿½-looking crowd. &#x201c;Genuine vision, expressed artistically by Shakespeare in the character Puck, is more than the ability to open your eyes, take a look around, and see what&#x2019;s wrong with your life,&#x201d; I announced to these oversexed dope addicts.</p> <p>No one spoke or even looked up, and I had that terrible feeling I get at the kickoff to any rehearsal period, when I realize how much disappointment lies ahead. I said, &#x201c;Well, anyway, Theseus, it&#x2019;s your line to start the play.&#x201d;</p> <p>Still no one spoke. &#x201c;Danielle, do you have the cast list?&#x201d; I asked my sophomore stage manager.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hang on, Mr. Barry, it&#x2019;s here somewhere.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Call me Reg,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;During the play, we&#x2019;re all equals.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stared at me like she wasn&#x2019;t quite sure. Unorthodox etiquette is often perplexing for the young. She held up the cast list and waved it&#x2014;apparently some kind of &#x201c;theatrical&#x201d; gesture&#x2014;in the air over her head. &#x201c;Greg Lippincott, you&#x2019;re Theseus.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, is that how &#x2018;Theseus&#x2019; is pronounced?&#x201d; Greg asked. It was hard to believe he was one of the Philadelphia Lippincotts. He took a puff from his cigarette. Snickering could be heard. It took four hours to complete the read-through. Danielle delivered Martin Epps&#x2019;s lines to him, and Martin repeated each back, painstakingly, one word then the next, like a spy being briefed on a plan.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes,&#x201d; recited Danielle.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll. Put. A girdle. Round about the earth. In forty minutes,&#x201d; said Martin.</p> <p>I made a note to ask him to pick up the pace and not tap cadences on the floor with his cane. I made another note, to Jim Ferguson, warning him to avoid inserting &#x201c;like&#x201d; into Oberon&#x2019;s speeches to Titania. I worried about telling the faeries and goblins that their costumes would consist of G-strings and pasties.</p> <p>I can always give thanks, in these delicate situations, for our costumer, my girlfriend, Carol.</p> <p>Carol came in later in the week, during our first walk-through rehearsal, and made the case for her skimpy outfits.</p> <p>&#x201c;I think we will be able to see from their attire that these faeries are playful and very dangerous, earthy yet devilish, with a heightened insistence on gender that not only subverts our own male-dominated culture but underscores the young lovers&#x2019; cruelty toward one another in the Athenian grove,&#x201d; she announced while staring straight at me. Was it necessary for Carol to see <i>everything</i> as a reflection of the sexual antagonisms in our on-again, off-again relationship?</p> <p>She held the faerie sketches&#x2014;Cobweb, Peaseblossom, Moth, and Mustardseed&#x2014;up in glaring overhead light. A girl wearing shorts and a T-shirt objected: &#x201c;No way. I&#x2019;m not going out there naked.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is the theater, honey. The character is naked, not you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good point, Carol,&#x201d; I interjected, unwisely. Carol gave me one of her furious looks, reminding me that she was approaching a breaking point in our love affair. What can be said about this? After five years, it&#x2019;s a regular enough occurrence. The truth is that we&#x2019;ve never been very happy together. We pick at each other and have squalid fights. I&#x2019;ll spare the details, except to say that whenever I think about our fighting, or about Carol&#x2019;s drinking, I feel sad for us both; and this makes me want to phone her up and find out if she&#x2019;s doing all right; and <i>this</i> behavior, as will easily be understood by anyone who has lasted even a short while in a hostile erotic relationship, is almost invariably a prelude to knockout sex.</p> <p>&#x201c;What will <i>I</i> be wearing&#x201d; called a boy from the back of the basement. The boy was Sam English, a theater regular, bearded and deep-voiced; he was my Bottom. Carol said to him and to the entire cast, &#x201c;Costumes are designed to suggest historical period and class, while also referring to modern dress. Bottom and his fellow Mechanicals will wear weight-lifting belts over wool tunics with the characters&#x2019; names ironed on.&#x201d;</p> <p>It had been my idea to depict Shakespeare&#x2019;s vulgar tradesmen as a team of Elizabethan power lifters. I imagined them carrying six-packs of beer hanging from clear plastic rings. &#x201c;Let me see Bottom and his men at the front of the room, pronto,&#x201d; I called out, to begin that day&#x2019;s walk-through of the play within the play, act five&#x2019;s irresistible &#x201c;tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe.&#x201d;</p> <p>Here came Quince, the carpenter; Bottom, the weaver; Flute, the bellows-mender; Snout, the tinker; Snug, the joiner; and Starveling, the tailor&#x2014;in reality a cluster of political-science and religious-studies majors. These six huddled around me, and I said, &#x201c;You guys are fuckups and you&#x2019;re ugly. You&#x2019;re a bunch of functionally illiterate dipsomaniacs, and I&#x2019;d be amazed if any of you has ever been laid. Your own mothers ought to be ashamed of you.&#x201d;</p> <p>The boys looked confused, and I knew I had them where I wanted them. It is useful, when directing, to blur the boundaries between actor and role, to inaugurate, with a few stringent words, if necessary, a certain emotional instability; in this instance I was exploiting my students&#x2019; routine insecurities in order to lead them to identify with Shakespeare&#x2019;s motley artisans.</p> <p>I then gave these Merry Men my cautionary talk about the hardships of a life in the theater. At some point, I became aware of Danielle&#x2014;I could see her over Sam English&#x2019;s big head; she was waving and pointing at her watch, making those gestures and absurd faces people make when they need your attention, yet are afraid of you&#x2014;so I concluded, &#x201c;Boys, the point is this. People think the theater is romantic and magical. And sometimes it is. But most of the time it&#x2019;s just a pile of crap that nobody cares about.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Time for animal improvisations!&#x201d; Danielle shouted.</p> <p><i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, historians tell us, was probably first presented at a royal wedding held in the summer at a house outside London. Presumably, the guests, like wedding guests throughout history, became intoxicated with alcohol and the aphrodisiacal spirit of the occasion. Young couples, wandering in and out of doors, slipping away to flirt or break up or make love, had dramatic counterparts in the unhappy children lost in love in Shakespeare&#x2019;s imaginary grove. How many real lovers woke after the ceremony, hungover and sick, to discover themselves entwined on the lawn with mates met only during the festivities the night before? I wanted to create a world where love is mercurial, unbridled, bestial. In our production of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, the unmarried lovers would fall asleep after chasing one another through the forest; then, doused with nectar from Puck&#x2019;s flower, they would roll over, rub their eyes, and fuck the wrong person.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all get down on our hands and knees,&#x201d; I told the cast.</p> <p>Down we went. Right away I noticed that Mary Victoria Frost and several faeries appeared to be acting like house cats; these girls arched their backs, projected feline butts into the air, and hissed. Sheila Tannenbaum&#x2014;who, in act two, scene one, repeats the famous line &#x201c;Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me&#x201d;&#x2014;was doing a nice job as a submissive pup, rolling over and sticking out her tongue to lick Billy Valentine, slithering past on his belly. Lion roared and Bottom brayed like an ass, and Sarah Goldwasser, our Titania, responded by rubbing herself against Sam; it was clear that these two had a flirtation in the works. That&#x2019;s something I like to see. Sex makes any show better. &#x201c;Oink, oink,&#x201d; I said to Mary Victoria Frost.</p> <p>I love the theater. I really do. And I adored my cast. They adored one another, too; these boys and girls were becoming&#x2014;as the days became weeks and the play took its shape&#x2014;uninhibitedly smitten with one another. It was mid-May, and summer&#x2019;s first warmth was in the air. The basement felt stuffy and hot, thanks to the overheating furnace in the corner.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not out of the woods yet,&#x201d; I announced at the beginning of our third week. &#x201c;Those of you who haven&#x2019;t got off book, you&#x2019;re holding the rest of us up. Demetrius, time your entrances so you don&#x2019;t keep Helena waiting downstage. Titania, less kissing and more teasing when you&#x2019;re giving it up to Bottom in act four. Make him work for it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Reg?&#x201d; peeped a voice from the crowd. It was Sarah Goldwasser, the prima donna.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Sarah?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When will we get out of this gross basement and start rehearsing on the green?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Any day now. Roger and Emil are building the platforms in the trees, and they have to dig the hole for Puck. Once Puck&#x2019;s crater is finished, we&#x2019;ll move the show outdoors.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Crater?&#x201d; This from Martin Epps.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. In our <i>Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, the demons won&#x2019;t merely buzz around like woodland pixies; they&#x2019;ll come right up from the earth to grab us and pull us down to Hell. At any rate, Martin, I don&#x2019;t think your hole will be much of a problem after one or two on-site rehearsals. You&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; I assured the blind boy.</p> <p>It was one of those moments when a person (myself, in this instance) says something wholly untoward, and then, becoming aware of the faux pas and its implications, rushes blindly forward&#x2014;there is no other way to describe this adequately, except as a king of verbal blindness&#x2014;exclaiming additional horrors. &#x201c;What I meant is&nbsp;&#x2026; the rest of us will&nbsp;&#x2026; watch you crawling&nbsp;&#x2026; covered with dirt and sticks&nbsp;&#x2026; You can picture it&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t mean literally&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, Mr. Barry,&#x201d; said Martin Epps.</p> <p>&#x201c;Call me Reg,&#x201d; I reminded him, by way of apology. Then, addressing the room at large, attempting to regain authority: &#x201c;All right. Let me have all the young lovers over in the corner. Lovers, don&#x2019;t touch the boiler.&#x201d;</p> <p>Possibly&#x2014;I should say probably&#x2014;it was risky of me to attempt simulated sex with undergraduates.</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you think, gang? Is this something you feel you can comfortably do in front of an audience?&#x201d;</p> <p>Together we sat&#x2014;Mary Victoria Frost, Sheila Tannenbaum, Billy Valentine, and I&#x2014;in a cozy circle on the floor. Billy, I noticed, had his eye on Mary; he leaned back beside her, and you could tell he was angling to spy an opening in her blouse and glimpse a breast. Mary spoke: &#x201c;How dark will it be?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fairly. By act three, the sun will be setting.

Illustrated in full color in Thollander&#39;s inimitable style and described with engaging narrative by McGrew, these drives are through country that is stunning and dramatic: the mystical Ojai Valley to Ventura; Carmel Valley to Big Sur; and the wine-lover&#39;s favorite, Highway 128 through Napa Valley to Mendocino.

The action of the Clone Wars comes to a dramatic conclusion, and events are put in place for A New Hope. Battles rage in space, armies clash on alien worlds, heroes become martyrs, and friends become enemies-all leading up to the biggest, longest, and most incredible lightsaber duel in Star Wars history! This is the film that answers the questions, How did Anakin succumb to the dark side? What happened to Luke and Leia&#39;s mother? And why are there no Jedi around in the original Trilogy? Artist Doug Wheatley (Star Wars: Empire volume two) brings a level of life and detail to the adaptation that rivals that of the films themselves. An epic graphic novel not to be missed!</p><p>The graphic novel of <i>Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith</i> is a solid representation of the highly anticipated conclusion to the most popular film epic in history. Picking up the action from <i>Episode II, Attack of the Clones</i> as well as the animated <i>Clone Wars</i> series, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, pursue General Grievous into space after the droid kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. It's just the latest maneuver in the ongoing Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatist forces led by former Jedi turned Sith Lord Count Dooku. On another front, Master Yoda leads the Republic's clone troops against a droid attack on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. And like the movie, the action takes a quantum leap up when the Sith Lord in hiding unleashes his long-simmering plot to take over the Republic, and an integral part of that plan is to turn Anakin away from the Jedi and toward the Dark Side of the Force. Unless you've been living under a rock the last 10 years, you know that Anakin will transform into the dreaded Darth Vader and face an ultimate showdown with his mentor, but that doesn't matter. In fact, a great part of the fun is knowing where things will wind up but finding out how they'll get there. The end of this prequel trilogy also should inspire fans to want to see the original movies again, but this time not out of frustration at the new ones. Rather, it's the fond memories <i>Episode III</i> will trigger as it ties up threads to the originals in tidy little ways. But best of all, it seems like for the first time we actually care about what happens and who it happens to.<p> The 96-page comic adaptation by Miles Lane and Doug Wheatley (<i>Star Wars Empire</i>, <i>Superman</i>, and <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, among others) is attractive but obviously has to take some short cuts from the 137-minute film. The action scenes also are less dramatic than the <i>Clone Wars</i> graphic novel series. But it's a coup that this adaptation includes a late Yoda scene that was not in the film but is already rumored to be an extra on the inevitable DVD. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p>Miles Lane is a relative newcomer to writing comics and has done sterling work on the Star Wars franchise.

Behaviourist warnings in the 1920s about physical contact (&#39;Never hug and kiss them. Never let them sit in your lap&#39;) swung to Jean Liedloff&#39;s &#39;continuum concept&#39; that babies should be wrapped round mum and fed on demand. Today enthusiasts for the &#39;family bed&#39; are at war with Gina Ford&#39;s call for a return to the strict routines of pre-Spock days. Who is right and who is wrong?

The Week</p><h2>The Art of Palestinian Embroidery</h2><p>The Palestinian folk arts have a rich and fascinating history. Silk thread and embroidery, together with an expanding repertoire of symbols, are known to have made their way from China to the Holy Land along the Silk and Spice Routes before being introduced to Europe by Christian saints, holy men and pilgrims. Mainly using cross-stitch, Palestinians have continued to embroider their traditional motifs, giving them their own appellations and developing their own terminology. As clothing was of prime importance, Palestinian women wanted something personal, distinctive and handmade. By adopting the traditional styles and motifs of her area, a woman expressed her wish to identify and be identified with her cultural roots. Samples of late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century Palestinian costumes are considered to be representative of folk art at its best.<br><br>Through the vicissitudes of war and occupation, Palestinian folk materials have been dispersed, though samples are to be found in published material, in museums outside Palestine and in small private collections. Leila El Khalidi's work in identifying and recording the history and motifs in Palestinian embroidery will be of interest both to craftspeople and to students of folk traditions and is an important step in preserving the Palestinian heritage. The book is illustrated with a detailed appendix showing the principal motifs and with photographs of traditional costumes.<br></p><p>Born in Jerusalem in 1927, <b>Leila Hussein Fakhri El Khalidi</b> graduated from the American Junior College in Beirut before working, from 1943 and 1946, under the Palestine mandate government. From 1971 to 1978 she was head librarian at the PLO Research Centre in Beirut, then joined SAMED (the Palestinian Martyrs' Works Society), founding the Society's Central Library and heading a research unit for Folklore and Folk Arts and Crafts. Her efforts resulted, in late 1971, in recognition of the PLO Research Centre Library as the national library of the Palestinian people, and, in 1986, in the establishment of a folk museum collection within SAMED.

Allison lives in Trenton, Tennessee with her husband, daughter, and a houseful of pets.Grade 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;This volume has "3 Story Paths, 37 Choices, 16 Endings" to give children an interactive reading experience and varied outcomes. The text is short and has a somewhat robotic tone. Readers can be a runaway slave, a slave catcher, or an abolitionist. If they opt for the first choice, they are instructed to turn to page 13 to continue the story. There they find out that their father wants to escape, but their mother wants to stay behind. Now readers must decide whether to remain with one parent or go with the other. The text exclaims, "What a terrible choice!" Good point. Perhaps this is not the best topic for the series. After all, most slaves' options were not really good ones, so the story is somewhat of an exercise in futility. Throughout the book, reproductions of photos and illustrations from the period make the information visually appealing. <i>Underground Railroad</i> offers some historically accurate details but the choice of theme coupled with stilted writing makes it a limited purchase.&#x2014;<i>Carole Phillips, Greenacres Elementary School, Scarsdale, NY</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Politicians, think tanks, and political parties would not be where they are without monetary gifts. Yet, when it comes to celebrating donors, the media often praise liberals for their selfless giving and criticize conservatives for their selfish hoarding. But Ron Robinson and Nicole Hoplin, leaders of Young America's Foundation, set the record straight in Funding Fathers: The Unsung Heroes of the Conservative Movement. Part historical account of the conservative movement and part exposï¿½ about political philanthropy, Funding Fathers busts the myth that conservatives donate less money than democrats and exposes how the media, liberal organizations, and even conservatives perpetuate this lie. In Funding Fathers, Robinson and Hoplin reveal:<br>* How conservative donors have had as much influence on the conservative movement as people like Ronald Reagan and William F. Buckley Jr.<br>* Why anonymous donations can do more harm than good to the conservative movement<br>* How donations benefiting conservative ideas are often misappropriated at universities across the U.S.<br>* How conservative politicians and organizations use donations more efficiently than liberals<br><br>Money matters. But it is not the size of the donation that counts, it is the impact it makes. Funding Fathers shows how the unsung heroes of the conservative movement have not only influenced the past, but also how they continue to shape the future.</p><p>Praise for <i>Funding Fathers</i> <p> "This indispensable work is a must-read for donors to the Conservative Movement as well as those considering gifts to our cause. <i>Funding Fathers</i> tells the story of how the Conservative Movement really came to be, but more importantly, provides guidance on how to advance the next generation of conservative ideas, as the new Funding Fathers and Mothers." </p><p> --<i>75th U.S. Attorney General</i> Edwin Meese III </p> "Here is the authoritative account of conservatism's Golden Donors--the men and women of means and vision whose remarkable largesse has made the Conservative Movement the most important political movement in America." <p> --Dr. Lee Edwards, <i>Distinguished Fellow in Conservative Thought, The Heritage Foundation</i> </p> "This unique, insightful book informs us of the many principled "guardian angels" who were the essential wind under the wings of the winning Conservative Movement. The dedication, the courage and character of these patriotic men and women tell the whole story of how many of our shared principles were advanced due to their undaunted, generous leadership. "The future of our Land of Opportunity for all will require similar creative teamwork and unflinching determination to stand strong for Freedom!" <p> --<i>Virginia governor</i> George Allen </p> "<i>Funding Fathers</i> reveals the remarkable tale of how a handful of contributions sparked the proliferation of conservative ideas. The success of the Conservative Movement makes this an indispensible guidebook for anyone who seeks to financially advance a cause, whether their gifts are large or small." <p> --<i>Bestselling author</i> Dinesh D'Souza </p> "As a fundraiser I have observed that philanthropy usually results from vision and passion. These are wonderful stories about philanthropy in action. That is, people who believe in something and help make their vision become reality through a gift of time and resources." <p> --William T. Sturtevant, <i>Senior vice president for principal gifts, University of Illinois Foundation</i> </p> "Ron Robinson and Nicole Hoplin have written the first book of its kind. It is long overdue. It reveals inside information I've never read before of some of the major players of the Conservative Movement. I found the book packed with information--a lot of it never before disclosed. I was at once reminded of how a few individuals and families changed the course of history in this nation--much like our Founding Fathers at this country's birth." <p></p> --Jerold Panas, <i>Jerold Panas, Linzy, &amp;Partners, Consultants to Philanthropy</i> <p></p>The Heroes Behind the Conservative Movement <p> We all know about Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, but who knows about Holmes Tuttle, Henry Regnery, and Antony Fisher? Yet it was devoted conservatives like Tuttle, Regnery, and dozens of others, who paved the way for leaders like Goldwater and Reagan by financing and helping to create a conservative movement of ideas and people. In <i>Funding Fathers</i>, authors Ron Robinson and Nicole Hoplin tell the untold, behind-the-scenes stories of the men and women who made the conservative movement the giant force it is today. In <i>Funding Fathers</i>, you'll learn: </p><p> * How a chicken egg smuggler created one of the most influential economic institutes in the world <br> * How three California businessmen propelled Ronald Reagan into America's political consciousness <br> * How William F. Buckley Jr. turned a book deal and a $100,000 investment into one of the most influential publications of our time <br> * How "Spike" Hennessy helped resurrect Hillsdale College <br> * Why Clarence Manion was the father of <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i> </p> <i>Funding Fathers</i> is essential reading for those who want to know the inside story of the conservative movement and learn about its largely unheralded heroes.</p><h2>The Strongest Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance, Value Price: 21st Century Edition</h2><p>Like a redwood that towers above all other trees, The Strongest Strong&#39;s takes James Strong&#39;s classic concordance to unprecedented heights.

SEASHORE <br>Monday, January 7, 2013. <br><br>Felix brushes his teeth. Then he brushes his other teeth, the false ones, and slides them into his mouth. Despite the layer of pink adhesive he&#x2019;s applied, they don&#x2019;t fit very well; perhaps his mouth is shrinking. He smiles: the illusion of a smile. Pretense, fakery, but who&#x2019;s to know? <br><br>Once he would have called his dentist and made an appointment, and the luxurious faux-leather chair would have been his, the concerned face smelling of mint mouthwash, the skilled hands wielding gleaming instruments. Ah yes, I see the problem. No worries, we&#x2019;ll get that fixed for you. Like taking his car in for a tuneup. He might even have been graced with music on the earphones and a semiknockout pill. <br><br>But he can&#x2019;t afford such professional adjustments now. His dental care is low-rent, so he&#x2019;s at the mercy of his unreliable teeth. Too bad, because that&#x2019;s all he needs for his upcoming finale: a denture meltdown. <i>Our revelth now have ended. Theeth our actorth</i> . . . Should that happen, his humiliation would be total; at the thought of it even his lungs blush. If the words are not perfect, the pitch exact, the modulation delicately adjusted, the spell fails. People start&nbsp;o shift in their seats, and cough, and go home at intermission. It&#x2019;s like death. <br><br>&#x201c;Mi-my-mo-moo,&#x201d; he tells the toothpaste-speckled mirror over the kitchen sink. He lowers his eyebrows, juts out his chin. Then he grins: the grin of a cornered chimpanzee, part anger, part threat, part dejection. <br><br>How he has fallen. How deflated. How reduced. Cobbling together this bare existence, living in a hovel, ignored in a forgotten backwater; whereas Tony, that selfpromoting, posturing little shit, gallivants about with the grandees, and swills champagne, and gobbles caviar and larks&#x2019; tongues and suckling pigs, and attends galas, and basks in the adoration of his entourage, his flunkies, his toadies . . .<br><br> Once the toadies of Felix.<br><br> It rankles.

At the climax of <i>Grass for his Pillow</i>, Takeo's passion for his beloved Kaede was finally realized with their secret and forbidden wedding. As spring approaches, Takeo and Kaede prepare for war and embark on a campaign to reclaim their respective realms.

He came to Peru from the Pacific. He traveled through the South and Central America, among the Mayans, into Mexico and all of North America, then back to ancient Tula, from whence he departed across the Atlantic to the land of his origin. Who was this white Prophet who spoke a thousand languages, healed the sick, raised the dead, and taught in the same words a Jesus Himself? These are true Indian legends, gathered during twenty-five years of research by L. Taylor Hansen, archologist, from many different tribes all over the Americas. By consulting museums, libraries and experts on folk-lore, it has been possible to correlate the findings into this fascinating book, backed up by the spades of the diggers into ancient ruins, and by all the sciences with which L. Taylor Hansen is familiar. This is a book that will back up the New Testament of the East, with the Christian Indian legends of the West. In this book is proof that the Savior came not only to one continent, but to all the world. This book will strengthen your faith as no other could!</p><p>L.

But just before he cuts into his delicious pizza pie, he turns his back for one second--and the pizza disappears! A gang of hungry mice have taken Pat&#39;s irresistible creation away for themselves. Kids love pizza, and this cumulative Step 1 book, based on the poem &#34;The House That Jack Built&#34;, will whet their appetites for both pizza and books!</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1 Set to the familiar rhythm and cumulative rhyme pattern of "This Is the House That Jack Built," this beginning reader describes the sloppy cheese, spicy sausages, gloppy sauce, and floppy dough that are cooked into a pizza and enjoyed by dozens of mice, much to the cook's great disappointment. However, in order to make the rhyme work, the pizza is cooked in a "tray" rather than a pan, and the sausages are described as "choppy." Also, some of the words are not easy for beginning readers. Still, children will be carried along by the rhythm and the lively, colorful, and somewhat exaggerated illustrations.

Much information on paper and its manufacture in early paper mills. Illustrated. xi, 274 pages. 1976 , 8vo., cloth, dust jacket.. Rinehart and Winston.</p><p>The Middle Ages, writes French scholar Jean Gimpel, saw an extraordinary flourishing of technological development throughout Europe. With the era came waterwheels and clock towers, nearly uniform machine parts and improvements in public hygiene, vaulting cathedrals and towering city walls, and a notion of spiritual and earthly progress that promised better things to come. In analyzing the growth of precision in measurement and of the experimental sciences, and in considering the careers of medieval geniuses such as the architect-inventor Villard de Honnecourt, Gimpel clearly conveys the intellectual excitement of the time. Sadly, it was undone by religious intolerance, brutal warfare, and the arrival of the plague as quickly as it rose.</p><h2>Lectures on Tibetan Religous Culture</h2><p>Provides an introduction to the history and origins of the Lhamo.

His father, leading the wise and benevolent Council of Mages, protected and guided the citizens of the Golden City of the Bells. Young Mages in training--all men, for women were unfit to practice magic--memorized the intricate details of High Magic and aspired to seats on the council. </p><p>Then he found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic--or did they find him? Their Magic felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it. <br>Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic--and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side. </p><p>Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world full of magical beings--Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom.</p><p>The one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage. Turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate? </p><p>Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And then all the world will belong to the Endarkened.</p></p><p><b>The Books of Wild Magic</b><br><br>There were three of them, at the bottom of a pile of ledgers, very slender volumes bound in some fine-grained, dark leather, with just a touch of gilt on the spine. Kellen found himself turning them over in his hands with some puzzlement. There was nothing on the spine of each but a single image-a sun, a crescent moon, and a star. Nothing on the cover, not even a bit of tooling, and the covers themselves were in pristine condition.<br><br>Odd. Definitely out of keeping with the rest of the used bookseller's wares.<br><br>He opened the front covers. The title pages were handwritten, not printed. The Book of Sun. The Book of Moon. The Book of Stars. He leafed through the pages, trying to puzzle out the tiny writing. The contents were handwritten as well . . . and seemingly dealt with magic.<br><br>They shouldn't be here at all! Kellen thought with a sudden surge of glee. Books on magic were very closely kept, with Students returning their workbooks to their Tutors as they outgrew them. And these weren't any of the recognized Student books, or anything like them, as far as Kellen could tell. <br><br>Without bothering to look through them further, he put them on the top of his pile and caught the stallholder's eye.<br><br>"Got younger sibs at home, do you?" the man asked as he wrote up a bill of sale with the merest stub of a graphite rod. <br><br>"No," said Kellen, startled. "Why do you ask?"<br><br>"Well, children's stories.... The man gestured at the three books. He handed Kellen his receipt. <br>Kellen studied it in confusion.

Where not long ago an unmarried woman was ashamed to give public evidence of sexual desire by living with someone, today she must be ashamed to give evidence of romantic desire. From sex education in grade school to coed bathrooms in college, today's young woman is being pressured relentlessly to overcome her embarrassment, her "hang-ups," and especially her romantic hopes. <br> Meanwhile, the problems young women struggle with grow steadily more extreme: from sexual harassment, stalking, and date rape to anorexia and self-mutilation. Both men and women endlessly lament the loss of privacy and of real intimacy. What is it all about? <br> Beholden neither to conservatives who discount as exaggeration the dangers facing young women, nor to feminists who steadfastly affix blame on the patriarchy, Wendy Shalit proposes that, in fact, we have lost our respect for an important classical virtue -- that of sexual modesty. <i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a deeply personal account as well as a fascinating intellectual exploration. From seventeenth-century manners guides to Antonio Canova's sculpture, <i>Venus Italico,</i> to Frank Loesser's 1948 tune, "Baby, It's Cold Outside," <i>A Return to Modesty</i> unfolds like a detective's search for a lost idea as Shalit uncovers opinions about this lost virtue's importance, from Balzac to Simone de Beauvoir, that have not been aired for decades. Then she knocks down the accompanying myths one by one. Female modesty is not about a "sexual double standard," as is often thought, but is related to male virtue and honor. Modesty is not a social construct, but a natural response. And modesty is not prudery, but a way to preserve a sense of the erotic in our lives. <br> With humor and piercing insight, Shalit invites us to look beyond the blush and consider the new power to be found in an old ideal. She maintains that the sex education curriculum forced on those of her generation from an early age is fundamentally flawed, centered as it is on overcoming reticence -- what we today call "hang-ups." Shalit surprisingly and persuasively argues that without these misnamed hang-ups there can be no true surrender, no richness and depth to relations between the sexes. The natural inclination toward modesty is not a hang-up that we should set out to cure, but rather a wonderful instinct that, if rediscovered and given the right social support, has the power to transform society.</p><p>The 23-year-old author first heard of "modestyniks"--Orthodox Jewish women who withhold physical contact from men until marriage--while a freshman at Williams College. She was initially fascinated by the way in which they cleave to old ideals, especially amid a sexually saturated contemporary world. But more so, Wendy Shalit was aghast at how modestyniks are dismissed as sick, delusional, or repressed by the secular community. "Why," asks the author, "is sexual modesty so threatening to some that they can only respond to it with charges of abuse or delusion?" <p> In her thoughtful three-part essay, the author reveals an impressive reading list as she probes the cultural history of sexual modesty for women and considers whether this virtue may be beneficial in today's world--if not an antidote to misogyny. In an age when women are embarrassed by sexual inexperience, when sex education is introduced as early as primary school, and when women suffer more than ever from eating disorders, stalking, sexual harassment, and date rape, Shalit believes a return to modesty may place women on equal footing with men. She yearns for a time when conservatives can believe the claims of feminists and feminists can differentiate between patriarchy and misogyny and share in the dialectic of female sexuality. </p><p> While the young author's argument is often limited by naivetï¿½ and her own lack of experience, her profound intelligence and daring are undeniable. <i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a thought-provoking debut that introduces an original and exciting new feminist thinker. <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p><b>Wendy Shalit</b> received her B.A. in philosophy from Williams College in 1997.

Evidence about Stalin has always been opaque. Stalin himself orchestrated this, silencing his witnesses and systematically distorting, hiding and destroying documents. Service brings thirty years of involvement with Russia and its history to bear on this most controversial and enigmatic of figures, concentrating not simply on Stalin as dedicated bureaucrat or serial political killer, but on a fuller assessment of the man himself. His early years in Georgia, his youthful revolutionary activism, his relationship with Lenin, with his family, with his party members: all of these formative interactions will be subject to close scrutiny, as will the central episodes in his career. The events of the October Revolution, the Civil War, the Great Terror and above all the Second World War are more open to examination than ever before, and Service will probe these to explain the nature of Stalin&#39;s personality, career and impact.</p><p>Robert Service is the author of Lenin: A Biography, and Russia: Experiment With A People. Stalin completes the trilogy published by Macmillan. Previous works include his History Of 20th Century Russia (Penguin), and numerous other books on Russian history.<i>Stalin</i>, a sequel to Mr. Service's <i>Lenin: A Biography</i>, presents a richly documented, highly persuasive portrait of the man who transformed the Soviet Union into a modern military-industrial power, terrorized millions and ruled over an empire that would have been the envy of the czars... Brick by brick, Mr. Service constructs a solid, accessible work that does as much as one book can to explain Stalin as a human being, and as the architect of a system that still weighs heavy on millions of citizens in the former Soviet Union. (William Grimes <i>New York Times</i> 2005-04-13)<br><br>[An] excellent new biography...Robert Service paints a picture of a warped monster of a man, insatiable in his pursuit of power, ruthless in his treatment of real and imagined rivals, remorseless in his murder of millions. Service's innovation is to reveal Stalin's frailty--above all, his capacity for miscalculation. He made no blunder costlier than that of June 1941; yet he himself got off scot-free. (Niall Ferguson <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2005-06-12)<br><br>Service has written an unhurried, richly detailed and rigorously researched book, anchored in hundreds of sources--a vast but cleanly structured text, polished, fluent and brisk...Service gives us a portrait of a paranoid and murderous despot, not a one-dimensional, cartoonish baddie...Service greatly advances our understanding by deftly fusing the tale of the man with that of the doctrine to which he was fanatically beholden and the ethos and practices of the tiny underground party. (Leon Aron <i>Washington Post</i> 2005-04-17)<br><br>In Service's eyes, Stalin remains ruthless, cunning and murderous. But a richer and more complex individual emerges--and a more human one. Stalin is shown as lover, husband and father. A man who wrote poetry and loved singing. A serious communist political thinker and the best-read Russian leader since Catherine the Great...[Service] has written a masterly book, with great erudition, style and wit. Although there are still some Soviet-era archives that remain closed, this biography will surely stand the test of time. (Stefan Wagstyl <i>Financial Times</i> 2004-10-23)<br><br>This is effectively the first full biography since perestroika to encompass the economic, political, diplomatic, military, administrative and, above all, ideological dimensions, as well as the personal aspects of Stalin's colossal life. Gritty and unshowy, but enlightened by Service's compelling characterisation, magisterial analysis and dry wit, this outstanding biography of lightly worn authority, wide research and superb intuition will be read for decades. (Simon Sebag Montefiore <i>The Sunday Times</i> 2004-10-10)<br><br>A common perception of Stalin is that of an oafish backroom bureaucrat who bludgeoned his way to the heights of power. But this image does not do justice to the multi-faceted and fascinating person who emerges in this latest biography. Drawing on fresh archive material, historian Robert Service lays the man bare and places him within the context of his times. He paints a picture of a talented politician who was driven by a severe personality disorder to behave in the way he did...Humanising him, Service believes, will help to identify future tyrants. Here he has struck the right balance and produced an intellectually cogent and highly readable account. (Gavin Engelbrecht <i>Northern Echo</i> 2005-02-01)<br><br>Robert Service's brilliant biography of Stalin is a major work: the fruit of long research, profound insight and understanding of his subject. It offers a truly rounded and thoroughly readable portrait of this monstrous figure. (Andrew Roberts <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>In the course of this engrossing and well-researched book, Stalin emerges as a fascinating, complex figure. (Andrew Roberts <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2004-10-09)<br><br>In his new biography of the Soviet dictator, Robert Service has given the most convincing description yet of how Stalin's insecure Georgian childhood fashioned his psychology. At key points in the book, we are reminded of Stalin's duality--on the one hand he was a proud Caucasian toughie who organized bank robberies and could drink spirits all night. On the other, he was a man who aspired to understand and interpret (crassly) high art and politics...This is the first serious political biography of Stalin since the opening of the archives in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the 1990s and Service has made good use of them. (Misha Glenny <i>Irish Times</i> 2004-11-27)<br><br>A profound and readable reassessment of the Soviet dictator... Service paints a picture of a ruthless man absorbed in the pursuit of politics, widely read, perceptive, cunning and, despite a self-effacing and isolated persona, the stuff of leadership... Stalin was no fool; he could scarcely have become dictator of a vast nation if he had been. Yet his contemporaries, and many historians since, have underestimated him. Service makes sense of Stalin's achievements by making us take him seriously... Stalin's power at its peak was immense and daunting. Service reminds us that a quarter of Russians recently polled put the Stalin years top of the list of periods in Russian history they most admired... This shrewd biography helps us understand clearly and dispassionately why not everyone remembers Stalin as a murderous ogre.

Sleek black, the new invention remained relatively unstable, despite the constant and ongoing refinement by the medics and techs, but Vasic wasn&#x2019;t concerned about his life.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t been concerned about anything for a long time. At first it had been his conditioning under Silence that kept him cold, his emotions on ice. Now, as the world navigated the first days of a new year, he was beyond Silence and into a numbness so vast, it was an endless grayness.</p><p>The only reason he kept waking up in the morning was for the others, the ones in the squad who still had some hope of a normal life. It was far too late for him, his hands permanently stained with blood from the countless lives he&#x2019;d taken in pursuit of a mandate that had proven false in a very ugly way.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he said to the man clad in a black combat uniform who&#x2019;d just entered the common area of Arrow Central Command. None of them were sociable, yet they maintained this space, having learned through bitter experience that even an Arrow couldn&#x2019;t always walk alone.</p><p>Today the room was empty except for the two of them.</p><p>&#x201c;Krychek has a theory.&#x201d; Aden came to stand beside Vasic, his dark eyes on the vista beyond the glass. It wasn&#x2019;t of the outside world&#x2014;the Arrows were creatures of shadow, and so they lived in the shadows, their headquarters buried deep underground in a location inaccessible to anyone who didn&#x2019;t know the correct routes and codes.</p><p>Even a teleporter needed a visual lock, and there were no images of Arrow Central Command anywhere in the world, not in any database, not on the PsyNet, nowhere. Which made it all the more notable that Kaleb Krychek had demonstrated the ability to &#x2019;port into the HQ when the squad first contacted him. However, despite the subterranean nature of the squad&#x2019;s base of operations, on the other side of the glass lay a sprawling green space full of trees, ferns, even a natural-seeming pool, the area bathed in simulated sunlight that would change to moonlight as the day turned.</p><p>It had been difficult to acquire that technology without tipping their hand&#x2014;the SnowDancer wolves were very proprietary of their tech, usually installed it themselves. But the squad had managed, because that light was as necessary to their sanity and their physical health as the captured piece of the outside world on which it shone.</p><p>&#x201c;Krychek&#x2019;s theory&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about the disease in the Net,&#x201d; Vasic guessed, aware that the broken remnants of fanatical Pure Psy and the sporadic new outbreaks of violence notwithstanding, that was the most dangerous threat facing their race.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen the reports.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; The disease, the infection, was spreading at a phenomenal pace no one could&#x2019;ve predicted. Rooted in the psychic fabric that connected every Psy on the planet but for the renegades, it had the potential to devastate their race&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because to be Psy was to need the biofeedback provided by a psychic network. Now that same link could well be pumping poison directly into their brains.</p><p>There were some who whispered that the fall of Silence a month prior was behind the acceleration, but Vasic didn&#x2019;t believe that to be the truth&#x2014;the decay was too deeply integrated in the PsyNet. It had had over a century to grow, feeding on the suppressed psychic energy of all the dark, twisted emotions their race sought to stifle. &#x201c;Krychek&#x2019;s theory?&#x201d;</p><p>Aden, his hands clasped loosely behind his back, said, &#x201c;He believes the empaths are the key.&#x201d;</p><p>The empaths.</p><p>An unexpected idea from Kaleb Krychek, whom many considered the epitome of Silence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that was a false truth, as the entire Net had learned when he had lowered the shield around the adamantine bond that linked him to Sahara Kyriakus. Of course, it was a false truth only when it came to Sahara Kyriakus. That was a fact Vasic didn&#x2019;t think everyone understood, and it was a critical one.</p><p>Kaleb Krychek remained a lethal threat.</p><p>&#x201c;Krychek,&#x201d; Aden continued, &#x201c;theorizes that the fact the empaths are so prevalent in the population speaks to their necessity in subtle ways we&#x2019;ve never grasped. Stifling their abilities has thus had a dangerous flow-on effect.&#x201d;</p><p>Vasic saw the logic&#x2014;empaths might&#x2019;ve been publicly erased from the Net, but every Arrow knew the E designation had never been rare. Except once. Their emotion-linked abilities contrary to the very foundations of the Protocol, the Es had been systematically eliminated from the gene pool in the years after Silence was first implemented, only for the ruling Council to realize almost too late that it was attempting to excise a vital organ.</p><p>No one truly understood why the Net needed the Es, but it was incontrovertible that it did. The Council that had first come face-to-face with that truth had named it the Correlation Concept&#x2014;the lower the number of E-Psy in the population, the higher the incidents of psychopathy and insanity. However, while the current generation of Es might&#x2019;ve been allowed to be born, they&#x2019;d never been allowed to be, conditioned to stifle their abilities since birth. &#x201c;Has Krychek considered the fact that it might not be a case of merely awakening the Es?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. You see the critical problem.&#x201d;</p><p>It was inescapable&#x2014;if the empaths had to do something active to negate the infection, then the Psy race might well disintegrate to ash, because there was no one left to teach the Es what to do. By the time the ruling Council of the time had accepted their mistake in attempting to cull the Es from the gene pool, all the old ones were dead and information about their abilities had been erased from every known archive.</p><p>&#x201c;How many?&#x201d; Vasic asked, knowing they couldn&#x2019;t simply begin to nudge the empaths awake on a wholesale level. Their deaths had almost collapsed the PsyNet. No one knew what would happen if they woke all at once, disoriented and unable to control their abilities.</p><p>&#x201c;A test group of ten.&#x201d; Aden telepathed him the list.</p><p>Scanning it, Vasic saw the short-listed Es were all high Gradient, from cardinal to 8.7. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, before Aden could make the request. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t retrieve them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to retrieve them all. Just one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Vasic said again. &#x201c;If Krychek wishes to abduct empaths, he&#x2019;s capable of doing so himself.&#x201d; Vasic was no longer on anyone&#x2019;s leash but his own.</p><p>Aden&#x2019;s response was quiet. &#x201c;Do you think I&#x2019;d bring you such a request?&#x201d;</p><p>Turning at last, Vasic met the eyes of the telepath who was the one individual in the world he considered a friend, their lives intertwined since childhood&#x2014;when they&#x2019;d been paired up to do exercises designed to turn Vasic into a stone-cold killer. To their trainers, Aden had simply been a useful telepathic sparring partner, a well-behaved complement to Vasic&#x2019;s erratic temperament at the time, an Arrow trainee only because his parents were both Arrows who&#x2019;d worked to hone his skills since the cradle.</p><p>As such, Aden had been put into classes that eventually qualified him as a field medic. He&#x2019;d been given the same harsh training all inductees were given, but was never deemed worthy of any extra interest&#x2014;except when it came to punishments designed to &#x201c;harden&#x201d; a boy who&#x2019;d been small for his age. Always, the ones who would use the Arrows had underestimated Aden, and in so doing, they&#x2019;d given the squad a leader who&#x2019;d saved countless lives and who they would follow into any hell.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Vasic conceded. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Aden knew exactly how close Vasic was to the edge, that the destruction of, or damage to one more innocent life could snap the razor-fine thread that bound him to the world.</p><p>&#x201c;Krychek,&#x201d; Aden continued into the quiet between them, &#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t think his proposed experiment as to the impact of the empaths on the infection will work if the Es are forced to participate.&#x201d; A pause. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not certain if that&#x2019;s his personal view, or if it&#x2019;s Sahara&#x2019;s, but whatever the case, each of the Es must volunteer.&#x201d;</p><p>Vasic agreed with Aden that the compassion was likely to emanate from the woman who had appeared out of nowhere to forge an unbreakable bond with the otherwise cold-blooded dual cardinal, and who, their investigations told them, was in no way Silent. &#x201c;Where does Krychek intend to run his experiment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;SnowDancer-DarkRiver territory.&#x201d;</p><p>Very few things had the capacity to surprise Vasic, on any level. This, however, was unexpected. &#x201c;The SnowDancer wolves have a tendency to shoot intruders on sight&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;shoot first and ask questions of the corpses&#x201d; was their rumored motto&#x2014;&#x201c;and the leopards aren&#x2019;t much friendlier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told Krychek the same, yet I can see his point as to the area&#x2019;s suitability.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An isolated location, no other PsyNet connected minds for miles in any direction.&#x201d; As a result, that part of the Net, too, would be quiet, giving Krychek a clean canvas on which to run his experiment.</p><p>However, that was a factor that could be replicated elsewhere.</p><p>Which left a single critical element that could only be found in the changeling-held territory. &#x201c;Sascha Duncan.&#x201d; Access to the only active E in the world no doubt played a crucial part in Krychek&#x2019;s plans.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no infection in that section of the Net,&#x201d; Aden said, instead of nodding to confirm what they both knew must be true. &#x201c;However Krychek has the ability to shift the infection in that direction, or seed the area with it. He says he can&#x2019;t control it beyond that, but I haven&#x2019;t yet decided if he&#x2019;s lying.&#x201d; The other Arrow turned to acknowledge another member of the squad who&#x2019;d just entered, walking over to her when she indicated she needed to speak to him.</p><p>Alone, Vasic considered the misleading simplicity of Krychek&#x2019;s proposed experiment. An isolated group of empaths surrounded on the Net by the infection. If the experiment failed and the infection threatened to overwhelm them in a wave of murderous madness or more subtle mental degradation, it would be relatively easy to relocate all ten men and women at short notice. As well, the deterioration of an empty part of the Net would cause few ripples.</p><p>In that sense, it was a clean plan, with no threat of major losses.</p><p>Of course, no one could predict how the infection would move, what it would do to the empaths. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Aden,&#x201d; he said when the other man returned to his side, their fellow Arrow having left the room.</p><p>Aden waited.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what happened when I had cause to pass near Sascha Duncan prior to her defection. It was a deeply&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uncomfortable experience.&#x201d; Councilor Nikita Duncan&#x2019;s daughter had been pretending to be Silent at the time, but even then, there&#x2019;d been something about her that had made his instincts bristle.</p><p>It was one of the few times he&#x2019;d felt true pain as an adult&#x2014;at first, he&#x2019;d thought he was under attack, only to realize it was Sascha&#x2019;s simple presence in a room separated from the one where he stood by a solid wall, that was sandpaper along the insides of his skin. As if some part of him knew she was the antithesis to everything he had ever been taught to be, the rejection primal.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until her defection and the resulting revelation of her empathy that he&#x2019;d realized the reason behind the strange effect; the knowledge had made him recall the numerous other times he&#x2019;d felt a faint irritation against his skin as he moved through the shadows in populated areas. Sleeping empaths, their conditioning not as badly degraded as Sascha&#x2019;s must have been.</p><p>He also knew he was an anomaly in sensing them in such a way&#x2014;according to Aden, no one else in the squad had ever reported the same. Vasic had a theory that the awareness was an undocumented adjunct of being a Tk-V, a born teleporter. Patton, the only other Tk-V Vasic had ever met, had often complained about an &#x201c;itch&#x201d; under his skin when he was in the outside world.</p><p>Regardless of whether that was true or not, the effect continued unchecked for Vasic, causing deeper and more frequent serrated scrapes over his skin as the conditioning of the Es in the Net fractured further with each passing day.</p><p>Aden took several minutes to reply. &#x201c;Uncomfortable, not debilitating.&#x201d; The words of a leader evaluating one of his men. &#x201c;The empaths will need a protection squad&#x2014;their designation has never been aggressive according to the historical records I&#x2019;ve been able to unearth so far, and none of this group are, either.&#x201d;</p><p>The telepath&#x2019;s tone remained even as he added, &#x201c;I want you to run it. You&#x2019;re the only man I trust to get them all out of danger if there&#x2019;s a sudden spike in the infection, or if the pro-Silence elements in the Net seek to do them harm.&#x201d;</p><p>Vasic knew that wasn&#x2019;t quite the truth&#x2014;the squad had other teleport-capable operatives in its ranks. No one as fast as Vasic, but fast enough. None of them, however, stood so close to an irrevocable and final descent into the abyss. &#x201c;Are you trying to put me on soft duty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Eyes on the greenery outside, but his attention on Vasic, Aden continued to speak. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t see it, but you&#x2019;re one of the core members of the squad, the one we all rely on when things go to hell. Outside emergency situations, the younger Arrows turn to you for guidance; the older ones use you as a sounding board. Your loss would be a staggering blow to the group&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t snap.&#x201d; Even though he knew the oblivion of death was the only peace he&#x2019;d ever find. &#x201c;I have things to do yet.&#x201d; And it didn&#x2019;t only have to do with helping to save those Arrows who might still have the chance to live some kind of a real life.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t have the right to be tired. When you can write her name on a memorial, when you can honor her blood, then you&#x2019;ll have earned the right.</p><p>A leopard changeling had said that to him over the broken body of a woman whose death Vasic had been sent to erase. The leopard couldn&#x2019;t know how many names Vasic needed to write, how many deaths he&#x2019;d covered up when he&#x2019;d believed that what he was doing was for the good of his people&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and later, when he&#x2019;d known it was too early for any revolution to succeed. Each and every name had a claim on his soul.</p><p>&#x201c;Nevertheless, I want you away from the violence, at least for a short period.&#x201d; Again, Aden&#x2019;s voice was that of the leader he was, and yet it was no order, their relationship far too old to need any such trappings. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another reason I want you on this detail&#x2014;and why I&#x2019;m going to ask you to consider certain others for your team. Being near empaths may be uncomfortable for you, but it will likely be soothing for the Es.&#x201d;</p><p>Because, Vasic realized, he and the others like him, were ice-cold, permanently cut off from their emotions. Unlike the fractured, they would leak neither fear nor pain, eliminating one source of stress on the newly awakened Es. &#x201c;How does that tie in with being so close to the changelings?&#x201d; The shapeshifting race was as rawly emotional as the Psy were not, their world painted in vivid shades of passion.</p><p>&#x201c;If Krychek manages to negotiate access to part of thei...</p></p><h2>Kathleen&#39;s Enduring Faith (Life of Faith, A: Kathleen McKenzie Series)</h2><p>Kathleen&#39;s Blazing Battle continues the story of an enthusiastic and determined twelve-year-old girl growing up at the dawn of the 1930s.

Two seventeen-year olds killed by an ex-Army loner who has gone off the rails. As Detective Inspector John Rebus puts it, &#39;there&#39;s no mystery&#39;...except the why. But this question takes Rebus into the heart of a shattered community. Ex-Army himself, Rebus becomes fascinated by the killer, and finds he is not alone. Army investigators are on the scene, and won&#39;t be shaken off. The killer had friends and enemies to spare - ranging from civic leaders to the local Goths - leaving behind a legacy of secrets and lies. Rebus has more than his share of personal problems, too. He&#39;s fresh out of hospital, hands heavily bandaged, and he won&#39;t say how it happened. Could there be a connection with a house-fire and the unfortunate death of a petty criminal who had been harrassing Rebus&#39;s colleague Siobhan Clarke? Rebus&#39;s bosses seem to think so...</p><p>Given his contempt for authority, his tendency to pursue investigative avenues of his own choosing, and his habitually ornery manner, it's a wonder that John Rebus hasn't been booted unceremoniously from his job as an Edinburgh cop. He certainly tempts that fate again in <i>A Question of Blood</i>, which finds him and his younger partner, Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke, trying to close the case of a withdrawn ex-soldier named Lee Herdman, who apparently shot three teenage boys at a Scottish private school, leaving two of them dead, before turning the pistol on himself.<p> "There&#x2019;s no mystery," Siobhan insists at the start of this 14th Rebus novel (following <i>Resurrection Men</i>). "Herdman lost his marbles, that&#x2019;s all." However, the hard-drinking, chain-smoking Rebus, who'd once sought entry into the same elite regiment in which Herdman served (but ultimately cracked under psychological interrogation), thinks there's more motive than mania behind this classroom slaughter. Perhaps something to do with the gunman's role in a 1995 mission to salvage a downed military helicopter, or with Teri Cotter, a 15-year-old "Goth" who broadcasts her bedroom life over the Internet, yet keeps private her relationship with the haunted Herdman. Rebus's doubts about the murder-suicide theory are deepened with the appearance of two tight-lipped army investigators, and by the peculiar behavior of James Bell, the boy who was only wounded during Herdman's firing spree and whose politician father hopes to use that tragedy as ammo in the campaign against widespread gun ownership. But the detective inspector's focus on this inquiry is susceptible to diversion, both by an internal police probe into his role in the burning death of a small-time crook who'd been stalking Siobhan, and by the fact that Rebus--who shies away from any family contacts--was related to one of Herdman&#x2019;s victims.</p><p> Now middle-aged and on the downward slope of his pugnacity (the high point may have come in 1997's <i>Black and Blue</i>), Rebus has become the engine of his own obsolescence. Overexposure to criminals has left him better at understanding them than his colleagues, and he only worsens his career standing by fighting other people's battles for them, especially Siobhan, who risks learning too many lessons from her mentor. To watch Rebus subvert police conventions and fend of personal demons (that latter struggle mirrored in <i>A Question of Blood</i> by Herdman's own) is worth the admission to this consistently ambitious series. <i>--J.

It&#x2019;s best to lose it slow and steady so that you can keep it off longer.&#x201d; <br>Given the relevant science, I always accepted the conventional wisdom of steady weight loss being more beneficial than rapid weight-loss strategies. But I still wanted to explore whether it was actually possible to lose weight quickly <i>and</i> in a safe manner. I finally concluded that the answer is yes, but only after taking a step back to first understand why weight-loss experts continuously caution against the rapid weight-loss approach. <br>Programs that have promised fast weight loss have for the most part been extreme and unhealthy. They propose either a severe restriction in calories; unregulated, non-FDA-approved supplements to help boost the metabolism; or eating plans that call for eliminating entire food categories. These programs have been successful for many, but the harm they can potentially do to the body can outweigh the potential benefits that one achieves with the weight loss. What good is losing 15 pounds quickly if it means you are damaging your kidneys? What good is losing 20 pounds if it means you are going to gain it all back and then some in three weeks once you stop whatever plan it is that you&#x2019;re following? <br>SUPER SHRED is specifically designed to be a short-term rapid-weight-loss plan. It is not meant for the long term. Instead, it is what I call <i>destination dieting</i>. You have a cruise to get ready for in two months? You have a reunion to attend in six weeks? You need to look your best at a wedding in four weeks? SUPER SHRED is your secret weapon to help deliver the results you want. But remember, secret weapons are best used only when the stakes are high. You have plenty of other weapons in your arsenal, but when you really need to deliver that knockout blow, then you call on your secret weapon. The element of surprise that is so critical on the battlefield is also critical in the weight-loss battle. If you overuse the same weapon, your enemy knows what to expect and can defend against it better, and eventually the weapon becomes less effective. Overusing SUPER SHRED can have the same impact on the effectiveness of the plan, which is why you should use it in short bursts. <br>The original plan, outlined in <i>SHRED: The Revolutionary Diet,</i> is meant to be the plan you can follow for the long term. It&#x2019;s a practical, inexpensive, straightforward program that delivers amazing results. In six weeks, the average person loses 4 inches and two sizes. People who have followed the original SHRED plan have mixed it up with SUPER SHRED to give themselves a boost. The results have been amazing, with the average weight loss each week being just over 5 pounds. <br>SUPER SHRED is a four-week program that is constructed in a way that will deliver the best results. There is flexibility built into the plan, but it&#x2019;s important to do your best to follow it as written. Our time to deliver is short, so that means there&#x2019;s little time to deviate and recover. This makes every day important, and it makes it necessary for you to plan, prepare, and execute as efficiently as possible. If you&#x2019;re going to do SUPER SHRED, make sure you have time to do it and that you&#x2019;re not trying to do it when you&#x2019;re distracted or not in control of your food environment. For best results, follow the program when you can give it all of the mental and physical attention it deserves and needs. <br>Weight loss in general is not easy. It requires lifestyle changes and breaking bad habits that have spun you and your scale out of control. It&#x2019;s easy to want the quick fix, but you have to be willing to put in the work that&#x2019;s necessary to achieve the results. SUPER SHRED is not a tough program, but it can be demanding, and it&#x2019;s purposely built this way. If your body is not challenged, then it will not transform. SUPER SHRED will push you, but it will not overwhelm you. You will get as much out of it as you put into it, so your expectations should match the level of intensity at which you choose to do the plan. <br>As with any weight-loss plan, the amount of weight people lose will vary. Our tests have shown that the average weight loss in four weeks is 20 pounds. But you have to understand the context of these results. Some people lost less, some people lost more. No two people lose weight in the same way or at the same pace. Some will lose pounds first, while others will lose inches first. Some lose them both at the same time. We are all made differently and respond differently to diets. Never compare yourself to someone else or you will set yourself up for disappointment. You are your own comparison and that&#x2019;s what you should be thinking as you begin SUPER SHRED. Think about how <i>you</i> have lost weight in the past and then compare your results on SUPER SHRED with those experiences. <br>How much weight you lose in these four weeks will depend on a lot of variables. There are many medical conditions&#x2014;for example, hypothyroidism&#x2014;that can slow or impede weight loss. There are many classes of medications&#x2014;for example, steroids or drugs to control blood pressure&#x2014;that have a side effect of weight gain, and this means they can impair your ability to lose weight. It also matters how much weight you really need to lose and how close you are to your target weight. Someone who has only 20 pounds to lose is most likely not going to lose it as fast as someone who needs to lose 60 pounds. It&#x2019;s a generally recognized axiom of weight loss that the closer you are to your target weight, the more difficult it is to lose the weight. Don&#x2019;t take it personally. It&#x2019;s just the way our bodies work. What you need to understand is that the body becomes comfortable and doesn&#x2019;t want to release those last 15 or 20 pounds, so it puts up a fight not to let them go. This doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t lose them, but it does mean you have to be focused and determined and work hard to win. <br>There are many strategies at work in SUPER SHRED, but the three that are most critical are negative energy balance, calorie disruption, and sliding nutrient density. While each one alone can bring success when it comes to weight loss, I have merged all three into one program so that you can draw from the entire group and achieve maximal results. <br>Negative Energy Balance <br>Negative energy balance is an extremely important concept when it comes to weight loss and it&#x2019;s especially important in SUPER SHRED. The concept is rather simple. Energy balance describes the relationship between the calories that are consumed through food and drink (energy in) and calories that the body uses throughout the day during all activities (energy out). This relationship determines whether one maintains weight, loses weight, or gains weight. <br>Negative energy balance means that the energy you consume is less than the energy you expend. When your body is in this state, it is looking for energy, because it&#x2019;s not getting enough in food and drinks. The body has three major sources of energy&#x2014;carbohydrates, fats, and protein. Your body also tends to use those sources in that particular order. Fat is a great source of energy, which is why we need it to live. When we consume more energy than we actually burn off, the body stores this energy in our fat cells. When the body needs energy to perform activities such as exercising, putting away dishes, or eating, it will use the energy found in carbohydrates first, but this runs out pretty quickly. The body will then go into the fat cells to get the energy that it has been storing. Proteins are the last to be tapped. <br>SUPER SHRED puts your body in a state of negative energy balance so that you will go into your fat stores for the energy, thus reducing the amount of fat while at the same time losing pounds. Exercise is critical during this four-week program, because it will create the demand for energy and thus the need to burn fat to get this energy. The calories you consume each day have been particularly measured so that your body will achieve this state of negative energy balance. You won&#x2019;t need to count calories during the entire program, as I have done all of that for you, but you will need to pay attention to the instructions regarding sizing and portions of food and drinks. <br>Calorie Disruption <br>It is common knowledge by now that in order to lose weight, the calories coming in must be fewer than the calories going out. Emerging research, however, has added some new twists to this old truth. Scientists have been taking a closer look at important issues such as metabolism, calorie consumption, and fasting. As you can imagine with new concepts, not everyone is in agreement, but there is enough preliminary evidence to elicit serious interest from major research institutes. <br> <i>Intermittent fasting</i> is a concept in which one fasts on a given number of days. The basic strategy calls for alternating days where you eat &#x201c;normally&#x201d; with days in which your calorie consumption is not completely eliminated but severely restricted. For example, you might eat 2,500 calories five days in a row, then eat 700 calories a day for the next two days. These two days are called your fasting days. Some small studies have shown that this can be as effective as or more effective than counting calories every day to lose weight. But the research shows that there are more benefits than just what you record on the scale. Some of the evidence has shown that blood pressure is reduced, levels of sugars and fats in circulation are improved, and inflammation&#x2014;an indicator of heart disease risk&#x2014;can be limited. <br>Despite the need for larger and longer studies, intermittent fasting remains a potentially promising concept that could yield big weight-loss results. SUPER SHRED employs an aspect of intermittent fasting that I call calorie disruption. The reduction of calories is not as severe as you will find in typical intermittent-fasting regimens, but the daily calories are meticulously planned so that you do experience abrupt shifts in the amount you consume. This is represented particularly by the SUPER SHREDDER days. Each week there is a day in which the amount of calories you consume will be quite different from what you have consumed earlier in the week and what you will consume later in the week. It&#x2019;s very important during these days to stick to the plan and make sure you eat all of your snacks and meals that day. This is a day that you will be particularly challenged, but if you plan correctly and remember what this day represents, then you will be fine. Most important is the psychological aspect to the SUPER SHREDDER day. Having a positive attitude is critical. You must remember that it is only 24 hours, and you can do <i>anything</i> for 24 hours. <br>Beyond the SUPER SHREDDER day, your calories are on a roller coaster between meals and even between the non&#x2013;SUPER SHREDDER days. Once again, you won&#x2019;t be counting calories, but the foods, beverages, and portion sizes I have selected will keep challenging your body with their variety and thus have an impact on your metabolism. The ability to alter your metabolism through food choices and to match this alteration with the exercise program can make a huge difference in the results that you eventually achieve. <br>In the original SHRED program, calories were altered from week to week, but SUPER SHRED has more dramatic alterations. The rises and dips and turns in this program constantly challenge you and make your body search for new stability. The trick, however, is that this stability is rarely if ever achieved, thus leading to a state of instability that consequently causes you to need more calories and effectively burn more fat. <br>Sliding Nutrient Density <br>Most people are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Entire books have been written about whether a diet dominated by plants or meat is healthier. While meat in moderation and cooked in a healthy way can contribute important nutrients to your diet, a plant-based diet remains the healthiest eating style with regard to disease prevention, a longer life span, and weight loss. <br>Nutrient density is the quantity of nutrients you get for the number of calories contained in that food or beverage. The ideal situation is to get the most nutrients for the fewest calories. In other words, nutrient-dense foods give you the biggest nutritional bang for your calorie buck. SUPER SHRED works because it provides you with tremendous nutrient density and it does so by sliding the cuisine away from heavy meats, cream sauces, and carbohydrate-rich foods that provide only some nutrients but at the cost of a lot of calories. Instead, the ratio is changed in the SUPER SHRED plan so that you are loading up on healthy nutrients but minimizing the amount of calories you consume. <br>You can have vegetables, meat, and fish; however, the way the daily menus are constructed, the majority of your choices in the later part of each day will be plant-based instead of meat-based. In other words, this is an omnivore&#x2019;s diet with a lot of nutrient density, but it tilts toward the plant aspect, thus loading you up on all kinds of disease fighters such as antioxidants and fiber. This strategy also means that you will be reducing the number of calories you consume through the day, with your earlier meals typically being heavier than those that come later in the day. This is important, because as we become less active later in the day and have less time to burn off calories, we want to make sure the foods we consume also contain fewer calories. <br>Eating meat or fish is not mandatory in SUPER SHRED. Vegetarians of all types can have great success with this program. Simply make the necessary substitutions where you need to in the daily menus, and you will be completely fine. <br>SUPER SHRED Weeks <br>There are four weeks of SUPER SHRED, and each one can stand on its own. Each week, however, does weave into the larger plan, so the weeks work on a progressive strategy. Each week has a different theme and purpose. The four weeks symbolize what is happening during SUPER SHRED&#x2014;losing weight F-A-S-T. <br>Foundation is the first week. Because we have only four weeks to attain the desired results, it&#x2019;s important to jump right in. This is the easiest of the weeks and it sets a good foundation for you to successfully complete the rest of the program. You will understand the importance of meal timing and preparation and how to pace yourself so that your exercise and eating are synchronized to give you the results you desire. Most people lose 5 pounds this week; some lose even more. Results do, however, vary and depend on a host of factors. <br>Accelerate is the second week, and it looks and feels different from Foundation week. This week is specifically designed to push you. Most people see a dramatic slowdown during the second week of any weight-loss program. To help you avoid such a plateau, this week is designed to help you accelerate through the natural slowdown. You might not lose as much weight as you did during the first week, but you will keep losing and avoid the second-week blues. The push in this week is critical, since at its completion you will be halfway through the program. <br>Shape is the third week of the program and carries this name because this is the week in which your body&#x2019;s metamorphosis really takes shape and you and others will start to notice a distinct difference. You will see changes in the shape of your body and the fit of your clothes, and the acknowledgment from others that you are losing weight becomes frequent and gratifying.

Edgar Hoover in the Assassination of President Kennedy</h2><p>Argues that former F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover possessed full knowledge of a plan to assassinate President Kennedy but did nothing to prevent it</p><p><strong>Mark North</strong> earned a BA in history with honors from California State University at San Diego, a law degree from Oklahoma City University, and studied business at the University of Texas at Austin. He is a former Texas attorney, a historian, and author of <em>Act of Treason: The Role of J.Edgar Hoover in the Assassination of President Kennedy</em>, has been investigating the Kennedy assassination for three over decades. He currently resides in Austin, Texas.Strong scenario by a Texas attorney for J. Edgar Hoover's complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy by the Carlos Marcello mafia family of New Orleans. Readers of Mark Lane's Plausible Denial (reviewed above) will be hard-pressed to correlate North's evidence with Lane's eyewitness account (taken under oath) of CIA master-spy E. Howard Hunt's payoff to the actual killers, implicating the CIA as the top conspirator. But North's evidence also takes on force and in no way can be seen as cheap and sleazy. What's clear from both books is that Warren Commission members gave false testimony frequently and that the Commission's report can be written off as a fabrication aimed at relieving the populace of worry about a conspiracy. After reading these two books, nobody could believe that Oswald alone killed Kennedy. North focuses on the upcoming forced retirement of Hoover as director of the FBI (to take place when Kennedy won his second term) and Hoover's bitter resistance to that ouster and animus toward Attorney General Robert Kennedy. RFK was making it superhot for the mafia, while Hoover, the AG's investigative arm, was refusing to cooperate. Through electronic surveillance, Hoover learned that Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa had put out a contract on RFK, while later surveillance apparently revealed that the Marcello crime family was organizing a hit on JFK, whose loss would dampen RFK's ardor to indict them. The law says that Hoover was bound to report these death threats to the Secret Service. Instead, North argues, he sat on them and entered into a sweetheart pact with Vice President Johnson, who was sweating over his criminal acts in Texas that were about to be revealed by RFK. With the Kennedys silenced, Johnson and Hoover would be in clover. North's general lines of reasoning are abundantly enforced by Hoover's own memos, among other sources.

Cornelia Thorne, Lady Brookfield, stood near the center of the ballroom. "Just look at him out there dancing...so completely bored. Him a duke and her such a mousy little thing, completely terrified of the man, I'll wager."<br><br>The Duchess of Sheffield, Miriam Saunders, raised her quizzing glass to peer at her son, Rafael, Duke of Sheffield. Miriam and her sister, Cornelia, were attending a charity ball along with Rafael and his betrothed, Lady Mary Rose Montague. The evening, a benefit for the London Widows and Orphans Society, was being held in the magnificent ballroom of the Chesterfield Hotel.<br><br>"The girl is actually quite lovely," the duchess defended, "so blond and petite, just a bit shy, is all." Unlike her son, the duke, who was tall and dark, with eyes even bluer than her own. And there was Rafe, himself, a strong, incredibly handsome man whose powerful presence seemed to overshadow the young woman he had chosen to be his future bride.<br><br>"I'll grant, she is pretty," Cornelia said, "in a rather whitewashed sort of way. Still, it seems a shame."<br><br>"Rafael is finally doing his duty. It is past time he took a wife. Perhaps they don't suit as well as I would have liked, but the girl is young and strong, and she will bear him healthy sons." And yet, as her sister had said, Miriam couldn't miss the bland, bored expression on her son's very handsome face.<br><br>"Rafael was always so dashing," Cornelia said a bit wistfully. "Do you not remember the way he was before? So full of fire, so passionate about life in those days. Now...well, he is always so restrained. I do miss the vibrant young man he used to be."<br><br>"People change, Cornelia. Rafe learned the hard way where those sorts of emotions can lead."<br><br>Cornelia grunted. "You're talking about The Scandal." Thin and gray-haired, she was older than the duchess by nearly six years. "How could anyone forget Danielle.? Now, there was a woman Rafael's equal. 'Tis a shame she turned out to be such a disappointment."<br><br>The duchess cast her sister a glance, not wanting a reminder of the terrible scandal they had suffered because of Rafe's former betrothed, Danielle Duval.<br><br>The dance ended and the couples began dispersing from the dance floor. "Hush," Miriam warned. "Rafe and Mary Rose are coming this way." The girl was nearly a foot shorter than the duke, blond, blue-eyed and fair, the perfect picture of English femininity. She was also the daughter of an earl, with a very sizable dowry. Miriam prayed her son would find at least some measure of happiness with the girl.<br><br>Rafe made a polite, formal bow. "Good evening, Mother. Aunt Cornelia."<br><br>Miriam smiled. "You're both looking quite splendid tonight." And they did. Rafe in dove-gray breeches and a navy-blue tailcoat that set off the blue of his eyes, and Mary Rose in a gown of white silk trimmed with delicate pink roses.<br><br>"Thank you, Your Grace," said the girl, with a very proper curtsy.<br><br>Miriam frowned. Was her hand trembling where it rested on the sleeve of Rafe's coat? Dear God, the child would soon be a duchess. Miriam fervently prayed she would manage to infuse a bit of backbone into her spine as the months went along.<br><br>"Would you care to dance, Mother?" Rafe asked politely.<br><br>"Later, perhaps." "Aunt Cornelia?"<br><br>But Cornelia was staring at the doorway, her mind a thousand miles away. Miriam followed her gaze, as did Rafael and his betrothed.<br><br>"Speak of the devil." Cornelia whispered beneath her breath.<br><br>Miriam's eyes widened and her heartbeat quickened, turned wildly erratic. She recognized the short, plump little woman entering the ballroom, Flora Chamberlain, Dowager Countess Wycombe. And she also knew the tall, slender, red-haired woman who was the countess's niece.<br><br>Miriam's mouth thinned into a hostile line. A few feet away, her son's expression shifted from incredulity to anger, deepening the slight cleft in his chin.<br><br>Cornelia continued to stare. "Of all the nerve!"<br><br>A muscle tightened along Rafe's jaw, but he didn't say a word.<br><br>"Who is that?" asked Mary Rose.<br><br>Rafe ignored her. His gaze remained locked on the elegant creature entering the ballroom behind her aunt. Danielle Duval had been living in the country for the past five years. After The Scandal, she had been banished, shamed into leaving the city. Since her father was dead and her mother had disowned her for what she had done, she had moved in with her aunt, Flora Duval Chamberlain. Until tonight, she had remained in the country.<br><br>The duchess couldn't imagine what Danielle was doing back in London, or what had possessed her to come to a place where she was so obviously not welcome.<br><br>"Rafael.?" Lady Mary Rose looked up at him with a worried expression. "What is it?"<br><br>Rafe's gaze never wavered. Something flashed in his intense blue eyes, something hot and wild Miriam hadn't seen there in nearly five years. Anger tightened the skin across his cheekbones. He took a steadying breath and fought to bring himself under control.<br><br>Looking down at Mary Rose, he managed a smile. "Nothing to be concerned about, sweeting. Nothing at all." He took her gloved hand and rested it once more on the sleeve of his coat. "I believe they are playing a rondele. Shall we dance?"<br><br>He led her away without waiting for an answer. Miriam imagined it would always be that way&#x2014;Rafe commanding, Mary Rose obeying like a good little girl.<br><br>The duchess turned back to Danielle Duval, watched her moving along behind her rotund, silver-haired aunt, head held high, ignoring the whispers, the stares, walking with the grace of the duchess she should have been.<br><br>Thank heaven the girl's true nature had come out before Rafael had married her.<br><br>Before he fell even more in love with her.<br><br>The duchess looked again at petite Mary Rose, thought of the biddable sort of wife she would make, nothing at all like Danielle Duval, and suddenly she felt grateful.<br><br>Crystal chandeliers gleamed down from the lavish, inlaid ceilings of the magnificent ballroom, casting a soft glow over the polished parquet floors. Huge vases of yellow roses and white chrysanthemums sat on pedestals along the wall. The elite of London's elite filled the room, dancing to the music of a ten-piece orchestra in pale blue livery, members of the <em>ton </em>attending the gala in support of the London Widows and Orphans Society.<br><br>At the edge of the dance floor, Cord Easton, Earl of Brant, and Ethan Sharpe, Marquess of Belford, stood next to their wives, Victoria and Grace, watching the couples moving around the floor.<br><br>"Do you see what I see?" Cord drawled, his gaze turning away from the dancers to the pair of women walking along the far wall of the room. "I swear my eyes must be deceiving me." Cord was a big man, powerfully built, with dark brown hair and golden brown eyes. He and Ethan were the duke's best friends.<br><br>"What are you looking at so intently?" His wife, Victoria, followed the line of his vision.<br><br>"Danielle Duval," Ethan answered, surprised. "I can't believe she has the nerve to come here." Ethan was as tall as the duke, lean and broad-shouldered, with black hair and very light blue eyes.<br><br>"Why, she's beautiful...." Grace Sharpe stared in awe at the tall, slender redhead. "No wonder Rafe fell in love with her."<br><br>"Mary Rose is beautiful, too," Victoria defended.<br><br>"Yes, of course she is. But there is something about Miss Duval.can you not see?"<br><br>"There is something about her, all right," Cord growled. "She's a treacherous little baggage with the heart of a snake and not the least bit of conscience. Half of London knows what she did to Rafe. She isn't welcome here, I can tell you."<br><br>Cord's gaze found the duke, who was concentrating on his petite blond dancing partner with an interest he had never shown in her before. "Rafe must have seen her. Damnation&#x2014;why did Danielle have to come back to London?"<br><br>"What do you think Rafe will do?" Victoria asked. "Ignore her. Rafe won't stoop to her level. He has too much self-control for that."<br><br>Danielle Duval fixed her gaze straight ahead and continued walking behind her aunt. They were headed for a spot at the back of the room, a place where Dani could remain for the most part out of sight.<br><br>From the corner of her eye, she saw a woman turn abruptly away from her, giving Danielle her back. She could hear people whispering, talking about The Scandal. Dear God, how could she have let her aunt convince her to come?<br><br>But Flora Duval Chamberlain had a way of convincing people to her will.<br><br>"This charity means everything to me, dearest," she had said. "You have been instrumental in all the good work we have accomplished and received not a single word of thanks. I refuse to go without you. Please say you will agree to your aunt's one small request."<br><br>"You know what it will be like for me, Aunt Flora. No one will speak to me. They will talk about me behind my back. I don't think I can bear to go through that again."<br><br>"You have to come out of hiding sooner or later. It has already been five years! You never did anything to deserve being treated the way you have been. It is high time you reclaimed your place in the world."<br><br>Knowing how much the ball meant to her aunt, Danielle had reluctantly agreed. Besides, Aunt Flora was right. It was time she came out of hiding and reclaimed her life. And she would only be in London for the next two weeks. After that, she was sailing for America, embarking on the new life she intended to make for herself there.<br><br>Dani had accepted a proposal of marriage from a man named Richard Clemens, whom she had met in the country, a wealthy American businessman, a widower with two young children. As Richard's wife, Danielle would have the husband and family she had long ago given up hope of ever having. With her new life on the horizon, coming to the ball at her aunt's request seemed a small-enough price to pay.<br><br>Now that she was there, however, Dani wished with all her heart that she were somewhere&#x2014;anywhere&#x2014;besides where she was.<br><br>They reached the back of the elegant ballroom and she settled herself on a small gold velvet chair against the wall behind one of the urns overflowing with flowers. A few feet away Aunt Flora, undeterred by the hostile glares being cast in their direction, made her way over to the punch bowl and returned a few minutes later with crystal cups filled to the brim with fruit punch.<br><br>"Here, dearest, drink this." She winked. "I put a splash of something in there to help you relax."<br><br>Danielle opened her mouth to say she didn't need alcoholic spirits to get through the evening, caught another hostile glare and took a big drink of the punch.<br><br>"As co-chairman of the event," her aunt explained, "I shall be expected to give a brief speech a bit later on. I shall ask for a generous donation from those in attendance, express my gratitude to all for their past support, and then we shall leave."<br><br>It couldn't happen soon enough for Dani. Though she had known what to expect&#x2014;the scorn she read in people's faces; the acquaintances, once her friends, who would not even look her way&#x2014;hurt even worse than she had imagined.<br><br>And then there was Rafael.<br><br>Dear God, she had prayed he wouldn't be here. Aunt Flora had assured her he would simply send a hefty donation as he had done every other year. Instead, here he was, taller, even more handsome than she remembered, exuding every ounce of his powerful presence and aristocratic bearing.<br><br>The man who had ruined her.<br><br>The man she hated more than anyone on earth.<br><br>"Oh, dear." Aunt Flora waved her painted fan in front of her round, powdered face. "Apparently I was wrong. It appears His Grace, the Duke of Sheffield, is here."<br><br>For an instant, Dani's back teeth ground together. "Yes.so it would seem." And Rafe had seen her walk in, Danielle knew. For an instant their eyes had met and held, hers as green as his were blue. She had seen the flash of anger before his gaze became shuttered, then the bland expression he had been wearing before he saw her fell back into place.<br><br>Her own temper climbed. She had never seen that look on his face before, so calm, so completely unruffled, almost serene. It made her want to hit him. To slap the smug, condescending look off his too-handsome face.<br><br>Instead, she sat in her chair against the wall, ignored by old friends, whispered about by people she didn't even know, wishing her aunt would finish her speech and they could go home.<br><br>Rafael handed his betrothed, Lady Mary Rose Montague, back into the care of her mother and father, the Earl and Countess of Throckmorton.<br><br>"Perhaps you will save another dance for me later," Rafe said to the little blonde, bowing over her hand.<br><br>"Of course, Your Grace."<br><br>He nodded, turned away.<br><br>"They will be playing a waltz a bit later," said Mary Rose. "Perhaps you would."<br><br>But Rafe was already walking away, his mind on another woman far different from the one he intended to wed.<br><br><em>Danielle Duval. </em>Just the sound of her name, whispering through the back of his mind, was enough to make his temper shoot to dangerous levels. It had taken him years to learn to control his volatile nature, to bring his emotions under control. These days, he rarely shouted, rarely lost his temper. Rarely allowed his passionate nature to get out of hand. Not since Danielle.<br><br>Loving Danielle Duval had taught him a valuable lesson&#x2014;the terrible cost of letting one's emotions rule one's head and heart. Love was a disease that could unman a man. It had nearly destroyed Rafael.<br><br>He glanced toward the rear of the ballroom, catching a flash of Danielle's bright hair. She was here. He could scarcely believe it. How dare she show her face after what she had done!<br><br>Determined to ignore her, Rafe went to join his friends at the edge of the dance floor. The instant he walked up, he knew the group had spotted Danielle.<br><br>He took a glass of champagne off the silver tray of a passing waiter. "So...from the astonished looks on your faces, I gather you have seen her."<br><br>Cord shook his head. "I can't believe she had the nerve to come here."<br><br>"The woman has unmitigated gall," Ethan added darkly.<br><br>Rafe flicked a glance at Grace, who studied him over the rim of her glass of champagne.<br><br>"She is quite beautiful," Grace said. "I can see why you fell in love with her."<br><br>His jaw tightened. "I fell in love with the woman because I was an idiot. Believe me, I paid the price for my folly, and I assure you it won't happen again."<br><br></p><h2>All-Time Favorite Sheet Cakes &amp; Slab Pies: Easy to Make, Easy to Serve</h2><p><p>Sheet cakes and slab pies have long been a staple at holidays, family reunions, and potlucks everywhere.

Formerly an adjunct professor at Trinity International University, he is currently on staff with Ravi Zacharias International Ministries in Norcross, Georgia. Copan is the author of True for You, but Not for Me."<i>Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?</i> gathers together an unprecedented range of persons involved in the contemporary study of Jesus. Placing these key voices on the stage together, so to speak, gives us a feel for the texture of the discussion that belies typical us-and-them, black-and-white categories. The result for the reader is unparalleled access into how historical assumptions, faith commitments, and philosophical premises shape how we read 'the historical Jesus'." -- <i>Joel B. Green, Asbury Theological Seminary</i><br><br>"Genuine dialogue between evangelicals and members of the Jesus Seminar is very rare. This book is notable for the fairness of its format, and the forthright nature of the exchange, which is candid yet always civil in character. One could hardly find a better representative of the Jesus Seminar than John Dominic Crossan, and William Craig may be the best apologist for orthodox Christian faith at work today. The additional commentators and the final summaries of Craig and Crossan are extremely helpful. What the debate format may cost in clarity and precision is more than made up for by the liveliness of the exchange. An exciting, helpful book." -- <i>C. Stephen Evans, Professor of Philosophy and Dean for Research and Scholarship, Calvin College; author of The Historical Christ and the Jesus of Faith</i><br><br>"Much current discussion of Jesus seems to be a dialogue of the deaf. In this book the different positions start listening to each other, probing, challenging, explaining, exploring. The informal setting of the dialogue is far more revealing, and truly interesting than the average scholarly monograph. This book will help people to get to grips with what is really going on, and what is really at stake, in the contemporary debate." -- <i>N. T. Wright, Dean of Lichfield, author of <i>Jesus and the Victory of God</i></i><br><br>"The debate by William Lane Craig, a leading evangelical apologist, and John Dominic Crossan, a founder of the Jesus Seminar, found in Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up? provides a helpful introduction to the issues involved in the modern discussion of the historical Jesus. The additional articles by four representative scholars responding to the debate help raise the key issue of whether 'the resurrection of Jesus' refers to something that happened to Jesus (Craig) or to his followers (Crossan)." -- <i>Robert H.

Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb had first met several years earlier, and their friendship had blossomed into a love affair. Both were intellectuals&#x2014;too smart, they believed, for the police to catch them. However, the police had recovered an important clue at the scene of the crime&#x2014;a pair of eyeglasses&#x2014;and soon both Leopold and Loeb were in the custody of Cook County. They confessed, and Robert Crowe, the state's attorney, announced to newspaper reporters that he had a hanging case. No defense, he believed, would save the two ruthless killers from the gallows. </p><p>Set against the backdrop of the 1920s, a time of prosperity, self-indulgence, and hedonistic excess, <em>For the Thrill of It</em> draws the reader into a lost world, a world of speakeasies and flappers, of gangsters and gin parties, that existed when Chicago was a lawless city on the brink of anarchy. The rejection of morality, the worship of youth, and the obsession with sex had seemingly found their expression in this callous murder. </p><p>But the murder is only half the story. After Leopold and Loeb were arrested, their families hired Clarence Darrow to defend their sons. Darrow, the most famous lawyer in America, aimed to save Leopold and Loeb from the death penalty by showing that the crime was the inevitable consequence of sexual and psychological abuse that each defendant had suffered during childhood at the hands of adults. Both boys, Darrow claimed, had experienced a compulsion to kill, and therefore, he appealed to the judge, they should be spared capital punishment. However, Darrow faced a worthy adversary in his prosecuting attorney: Robert Crowe was clever, cunning, and charismatic, with ambitions of becoming Chicago's next mayor&#x2014;and he was determined to send Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb to their deaths.</p><p>A masterful storyteller, Simon Baatz has written a gripping account of the infamous Leopold and Loeb case. Using court records and recently discovered transcripts, Baatz shows how the pathological relationship between Leopold and Loeb inexorably led to their crime. </p><p>This thrilling narrative of murder and mystery in the Jazz Age will keep the reader in a continual state of suspense as the story twists and turns its way to an unexpected conclusion.</p></p><p><p>Simon Baatzholds a joint appointment as associate professor of history at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.</p><p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley </p><p> </p><p> Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were sons of Chicago's Jewish aristocracy, youths -- Leopold was 19 and Loeb 18 -- who had been denied little in life and who gave every evidence of having brilliant futures. They were intelligent and had already graduated from first-class colleges. Yet on May 21, 1924, they did something appalling: They kidnapped a 14-year-old student named Bobby Franks, murdered him, dumped his body in a drainage ditch at Wolf Lake, several miles southeast of Chicago, and then tried to extract $10,000 in ransom from his parents. </p><p>Why did they do it? Less than two weeks later, after confessing to the crime, Leopold spoke to the state's attorney for Cook County and three psychiatrists. He said: </p><p>"I am sure, as sure as I can be of anything, that is, as sure as you can read any other man's state of mind, the thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement, or the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different; possibly . . . the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over. . . . The money consideration only came in afterwards, and never was important. The getting of the money was a part of our objective, as was also the commission of the crime; but that was not the exact motive." </p><p> The scheme was Loeb's. As a boy his "real passion . . . was for crime stories and detective mysteries," and as he grew older that passion only intensified. After he and Leopold carried out a petty robbery as a test of their criminal skills, he proposed that "they should commit a perfect crime, a crime so intricate and complicated that planning and calculating its flawless execution would be a challenge. . . . They should kidnap a child, he proposed, and to increase the intricacy of the crime, they should demand a ransom from the child's parents. The money was important, not for its own sake, but to magnify the complexity of the crime. . . . It was to be a brilliant crime, he mused, one that would shock Chicago with its daring. They would obtain the ransom, dispose of the body, and leave no clues behind; the police would never catch them." </p><p>It didn't quite work out that way. Three days after his murder, Bobby Franks's body was discovered by "a recent immigrant from Poland who worked as a pump man for the American Maize Company," and a week later Leopold and Loeb were taken into custody; they had left plenty of clues. The crime, the arrests of the privileged youths and the subsequent trial aroused the nation's attention much as did another famous case of the 1920s, the trial of the anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti for the killings of a paymaster and a guard during a payroll robbery in Massachusetts. The Leopold and Loeb case had no political overtones, as the Sacco and Vanzetti case had, and -- somewhat surprisingly, given prevailing attitudes of the time -- anti-Semitism does not seem to have been a significant contributor to public outrage over it, but it caught popular attention much as the O.J. Simpson case did seven decades later. </p><p>Zillions of words have been written about Sacco and Vanzetti, not to mention O.J. Simpson, yet as Simon Baatz points out in For the Thrill of It, "although the Leopold-Loeb case was one of the most infamous murders of the twentieth century, historians have largely ignored it." It has been the subject of novels (most notably Compulsion, by Meyer Levin) and the basis for movies (most notably Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope"). But when, several years ago, Baatz learned about the case for the first time, "no one had yet written a book that considered the episode in its complexity and intricacy." Hal Higdon published The Crime of the Century: The Leopold and Loeb Case in 1975, but it is little more than pop history. </p><p>Baatz -- formerly of George Mason University, now associate professor of history at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York -- has written a narrative history that aims, he says, "to recapture the drama of the events that it describes" but also to deal with the "complex issues that give the subject its significance." By and large he has succeeded. The book is overly long; presented with voluminous court documents, journalistic accounts and other raw material, Baatz sometimes quotes to excess. But For the Thrill of It is meticulous and thorough, and it puts the case in historical perspective as a clash between two conflicting views of criminals and crime, one espoused by Robert Crowe, the state's attorney, and the other by Clarence Darrow, who represented Nathan Leopold and was the most famous American lawyer of his day, perhaps indeed of any day. </p><p> "Criminals," Crowe believed, "were fully responsible for their actions and should be treated accordingly -- it was foolishness to absolve them of blame for their misdeeds." By contrast, Darrow was a "determinist" who believed that "the criminal did not freely choose wrongdoing; rather, factors outside his or her conscious control acted to determine criminal behavior. There was no such thing as individual responsibility. Imprisonment was futile and even counterproductive; it served no purpose either as a deterrent or as a punishment." Baatz continues: </p><p>"The trial of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb would be a contest between two charismatic individuals -- Darrow, who had built his reputation by defending unpopular causes; and Crowe, the most competent and energetic state's attorney in a generation. And there would be a second contest, a contest between opposing philosophies of crime and punishment. Which one would triumph?" </p><p>As it happens, neither side won a clear victory. Darrow and the lawyers for Richard Loeb decided before the trial began that it would be hopeless to plead not guilty by reason of insanity because "neither Nathan nor Richard was legally insane." So the not-guilty plea was withdrawn. The youths pled guilty. Their only hope was to be spared the gallows. To that end Darrow told the court, "The statute provides that evidence may be offered in mitigation of the punishment and we shall ask at such time as the court may direct that we may be permitted to offer evidence as to the mental condition of these young men, to show the degree of responsibility they had and also to offer evidence as to the youth of these defendants and the fact of a plea of guilty as further mitigation of the penalties in this case." Darrow, Baatz writes, "needed only to persuade the judge that they were mentally ill -- a medical condition, not at all equivalent or comparable to insanity -- to obtain a reduction in their sentence. And Darrow needed only one reduction -- from death by hanging to life in prison -- to win his case." </p><p>The irony is that though Darrow won in the immediate sense -- the youths were sentenced to life in prison -- he failed to win the broader legal and philosophical argument. That one was left unresolved. The judge reached his decision because "the court is moved chiefly by the consideration of the age of the defendants." Darrow and his associates had presented a formidable amount of evidence about the defendants' upbringing, psychological makeup and relationship with each other, including homosexual activities. Yet in the end, none of it amounted to anything. Darrow didn't keep Leopold and Loeb away from the gallows; a slightly soft-hearted judge did, and in doing so he said: "Life imprisonment may not, at the moment, strike the public imagination as forcibly as would death by hanging but to the offenders, particularly of the type they are, the prolonged suffering of years of confinement may well be the severer form of retribution and expiation." </p><p>Loeb lasted only until January 1936, when he was brutally stabbed and slashed to death by an inmate to whom he had made repeated sexual overtures. Leopold made it all the way to February 1958, when he was paroled. He moved to Puerto Rico, married, and, after he won his release from parole five years later, traveled frequently and visited old friends in Chicago. He died in August 1971. </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

But the day he taps into the line of a chemical company's CEO, a man with the power to order a clean merger - at any cost - Macklin's get-rich-quick plan starts to spiral desperately out of control. Hearing more than he should, he calls on his brother, NYPD officer Ray, for help. In a world where nothing is as it sounds, the Macklin brothers become the bait in a cutthroat game of blackmail, corruption, and violence. And Sean Macklin's dream of a better life becomes a fatal nightmare.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, April 2001:</b> Michael Ledwidge follows his exciting debut, <i>The Narrowback</i>, with another edge-of-the-seat thriller. Sean Macklin is a telephone repairman in New York City. While dealing with a problem on a line, Sean inadvertently plugs into a conversation that he should not be hearing--but he does. Sean's wife is disabled and they desperately need money, and the conversation is about a merger about to take place. Sean knows that inside information like this can pay off big, so he invests, making a handsome profit.<p> But Sean can't leave well enough alone. He knows that he risks his job tapping into the line of a CEO in a large investment bank, but he also knows that if he does this just a few times, he will have enough money to move his wife to Florida. But then he hears something he <i>really</i> shouldn't. The CEO, in a conversation with an overseas associate, suggests something that Sean knows is more than illegal--it's immoral. Outraged, he contacts his brother Ray, who is a cop, and lets him listen to a tape of the conversation. Sean would like to see the CEO busted and out of a job, but Ray has other ideas for the tape and he's not about to share those ideas with Sean. He asks an old street friend, Scully, to help him out, and between them they place in jeopardy everybody they know. By the time this story is finished we have been treated to a fable about greed that is about as dark as it can get. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>Michael Ledwidge</b> is a New York City telephone man and the author of <i>The Narrowback,</i> now available in paperback from Pocket Books, which he wrote while working as a doorman in midtown Manhattan.

A siege is approaching, and the city has little time to prepare. The people have no food and no weapons, and the enemy has sworn to slaughter them all. To save the city will take a miracle, but what it has is Orhan. A colonel of engineers, Orhan has far more experience with bridge-building than battles, is a cheat and a liar, and has a serious problem with authority. He is, in other words, perfect for the job. Sixteen Ways To Defend a Walled City is the story of Orhan, son of Siyyah Doctus Felix Praeclarissimus, and his history of the Great Siege, written down so that the deeds and sufferings of great men may never be forgotten. *** Praise for K.

It sniffs about.</i>&#x2014;Jean-Didier, biologist<br><br>How vividly I remember the first moments of my vocation as a clown! I was seventeen at the time, and spending a rather dreary month in an <i>all-inclusive</i> resort in Turkey&#x2014;it was, incidentally, the last time I was to go on holiday with my parents. My silly bitch of a sister&#x2014;she was thirteen at the time&#x2014;was just beginning to turn the guys on. It was at breakfast; as usual in the morning, a line had formed in front of the scrambled eggs, something the vacationers seemed incredibly fond of. Next to me, an old Englishwoman (desiccated, nasty, the kind who would cut up foxes to decorate her living room), who had already helped herself copiously to eggs, didn't hesitate to snaffle up the last three sausages on the hot plate. It was five to eleven, the breakfast service had come to an end, it was inconceivable that the waiter would bring out any more sausages. The German who was in the line behind her became rigid; his fork, already reaching for a sausage, stopped in midair, and his face turned red with indignation. He was an enormous German, a colossus, more than two meters tall and weighing at least one hundred and fifty kilos. I thought for a moment that he was going to plant his fork in the octogenarian's eyes, or grab her by the neck and smash her head onto the hot plates. She, with that senile, unconscious selfishness of old people, came trotting back to her table as if nothing had happened. The German was angry, I could sense that he was incredibly angry, but little by little his face grew calm, and he went off sadly, sausageless, in the direction of his compatriots.<br><br>Out of this incident I composed a little sketch about a bloody revolt in a holiday resort, sparked by the tiny details that contradicted the <i>all-inclusive</i> formula: a shortage of sausages at breakfast, followed by a supplemental charge for the mini-golf. That evening, I performed this sketch at the "You Have Talent!" soirï¿½e (one evening every week the show was made up of turns done by the vacationers, instead of by professionals); I played all the characters, thus taking my first steps down the road of the one-man show, a road I scarcely left throughout my career. Nearly everyone came to the after-dinner show, as there was fuck-all to do until the discotheque opened; that meant an audience of eight hundred people. My sketch was a resounding success, people cried with laughter, and there was noisy applause. That very evening, at the discotheque, a pretty brunette called Sylvie told me I had made her laugh a lot, and that she liked boys with a sense of humor. Dear Sylvie. And so, in this way, my virginity was lost and my vocation decided.<br><br>After my baccalaureate, I signed up for acting lessons; there followed some inglorious years, during which I grew nastier and nastier and, as a consequence, more and more caustic; thanks to this, success finally arrived&#x2014;on a scale that surprised me. I had begun with small sketches on reunited immigrant families, journalists for <i>Le Monde,</i> and the mediocrity of the middle classes in general&#x2014;I successfully captured the incestuous temptations of midcareer intellectuals aroused by their daughters or daughters-in-law, with their bare belly buttons and thongs showing above their pants. In short, I was a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> I was often compared to Pierre Desproges. While continuing to devote myself to the one-man show, I occasionally accepted invitations to appear on television programs, which I chose for their big audiences and general mediocrity. I never forgot to emphasize this mediocrity, albeit subtly: the presenter had to feel a little endangered, but not too much. All in all, I was a good professional; I was just a bit overrated. I was not the only one.<br><br>I don't mean that my sketches were unfunny; they <i>were</i> funny. I was, indeed, a <i>cutting observer of contemporary reality;</i> it was just that everything now seemed so elementary to me, it seemed that so few things remained that could be observed in contemporary reality: we had simplified and pruned so much, broken so many barriers, taboos, misplaced hopes, and false aspirations; truly, there was so little left. On the social level, there were the rich and the poor, with a few fragile links between them&#x2014;the <i>social ladder,</i> a subject on which it was the done thing to joke; and the more serious possibility of being ruined. On the sexual level there were those who aroused desire, and those who did not: a tiny mechanism, with a few complications of modality (homosexuality, etc.) that could nevertheless be easily summarized as vanity and narcissistic competition, which had already been well described by the French moralists three centuries before. There were also, of course, the <i>honest folk,</i> those who work, who ensure the effective production of wealth, also those who make sacrifices for their children&#x2014;in a manner that is rather comic or, if you like, pathetic (but I was, above all, a comedian); those who have neither beauty in their youth, nor ambition later, nor riches ever; but who hold on wholeheartedly, and more sincerely than anyone, to the values of beauty, youth, wealth, ambition, and sex; those who, in some kind of way, <i>make the sauce bind.</i> Those people, I am afraid to say, could not constitute a <i>subject.</i> I did, however, include a few of them in my sketches to give diversity, and the <i>reality effect;</i> but I began all the same to get seriously tired. What's worse is that I was considered to be a <i> humanist;</i> a pretty abrasive humanist, but a humanist all the same. To give some context, here is one of the jokes that peppered my shows:<br><br> "Do you know what they call the fat stuff around the vagina?"<br><br> "No."<br><br> "The woman."<br><br>Strangely, I managed to throw in that kind of thing, while still getting good reviews in <i>Elle</i> and <i>T</i>ï¿½<i>l</i>ï¿½<i>rama;</i> it's true that the arrival of the Arab immigrant comedians had validated macho excesses once more, and that I was genuinely excessive, albeit with grace: going close to the bone, repeatedly, but always staying in control. Finally, the benefit of the humorist's trade, or more generally of a <i>humorous attitude</i> in life, is to be able to behave like a complete bastard with impunity, and even to profit hugely from your depravity, in terms of sexual conquests and money, all with general approval.<br><br>My supposed humanism was, in reality, built on very thin foundations: a vague outburst against tobacconists, an allusion to the corpses of negro clandestines cast up on the Spanish coasts, had been enough to give me a reputation as a <i>lefty</i> and a <i>defender of human rights.</i> Me, a lefty? I had occasionally been able to introduce a few, vaguely young, antiglobalization campaigners into my sketches, without giving them an immediately antipathetic role; I had occasionally indulged in a certain demagogy: I was, I repeat, a good professional. Besides, I looked like an Arab, which helps; the only residual ideological content of the left, in those days, was antiracism, or more precisely antiwhite racism. I did not in fact know the origins of these Arab features, which became more pronounced as the years went by: my mother was of Spanish origin and my father, as far as I know, was Breton. For example, my sister, that little bitch, was certainly the Mediterranean type, but she wasn't half as dark as me, and her hair was straight. One had to wonder: had my mother always been scrupulously faithful? Or had I been engendered by some Mustapha? Or even&#x2014;another hypothesis&#x2014;by a Jew? Fuck that: Arabs came to my shows in droves&#x2014;Jews also, by the way, although in smaller numbers; and all these people paid for their tickets, at the full price. We all worry about the circumstances of our death; the circumstances of our birth, however, are less worrisome to us.<br><br>As for <i>human rights,</i> quite obviously I couldn't give a toss; I could hardly manage to be interested in the rights of my cock.<br><br>In that particular respect, the rest of my career had more or less confirmed my first success at the holiday club. Women in general lack a sense of humor, which is why they consider humor to be one of the virile qualities; throughout my career, opportunities for placing my organ in one of the appropriate orifices were never lacking. To tell the truth, such intercourse was never up to much: women who are interested in comedians are getting old, nearly forty, and are beginning to suspect that things are going to turn bad. Some of them had fat asses, others breasts like flannels, sometimes both. In other words, there was nothing arousing about them; and, anyway, when it's more and more difficult to get a hard-on, the interest goes. They weren't all that old, either; I knew that as they approached fifty they would once again long for something reassuring, easy, and false&#x2014;and of course they wouldn't find it. In the meantime, I could only confirm to them&#x2014;completely unintentionally, believe me, it's never a pleasure&#x2014;the decline of their erotic value; I could only confirm their first suspicions, and instill in them, despite myself, a despairing view of life: no, it was not maturity that awaited them, but simply old age; there was not a new blossoming at the end of the road, but a bundle of frustrations and sufferings, at first insignificant, then very quickly unbearable; it wasn't very healthy, all that, not very healthy at all. Life begins at fifty, that's true; inasmuch as it ends at forty.<br>Daniel 24, 1<br><br>Look at the little creatures moving in the distance; look.

Hagedorn has included traditionally structured fiction that directly addresses cultural experience: in ``Immigration Blues,'' by Bienvenido Santos, an ailing widower is approached by a Filipina who needs an American husband; the excerpt from Shawn Wong's novel- in-progress is a frank, cleareyed, often funny look at the cultural and racial subtext when two Asian-Americans have an affair; and several selections are outright family memoir or memoir-like. Some authors shatter myths of the ``model minority'' with stories of family violence, sexual transgression. There's also much experimentation here--usually focused on personal life rather than on culture and history: poetic meditation (notably, ``Afterbirth'' by Kimiko Hahn); a disturbing, self-conscious broken narrative from John Yau; an effective series of vignettes and incantatory passages by R. Zamora Linmark; the use of pidgin by Hawaiian writers Lois- Ann Yamanaka and Darell Lum. Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, less aesthetically pleasing but extremely influential, uses fragmentation and exhortation to write of Korean politics (``Melpomene Tragedy''). Best-known contributors include Cynthia Kadohata, Maxine Hong Kingston, Bharati Mukherjee (all with previously published work) and Amy Tan (a touching outtake from The Kitchen God's Wife). If there's bias here, it's a slight tilt toward the Philippines and to writers from the vibrant Bay Area multicultural scene: varying quality but largely inclusive--though surely needing an update soon to include Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian- American voices. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In her introduction Hagedorn ( Danger and Beauty ) calls Asian American literature "too confining a term" for these wide-ranging works. And indeed while the short stories and novel excerpts, nearly half being published for the first time, provide interesting reading, they seem to lack a cohering premise. Moreover, pieces by well-known writers like Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan are not particularly fresh. The most successful of the works paint sharp portraits of individuals. Gish Jen's Catholic-school girl is eager to work miracles, especially after her mother falls from a bedroom window during a fight with her father. Cynthia Kadohata's domineering grandmother insists on telling inappropriate stories and affects the narrator so forcefully that the girl swears, "Anything she does, I never will." Marilyn Chin's Moon is "a little fat Chinese girl" who is humiliated by two boys who urinate on her, and subsequently by her parents, then wreaks supernatural revenge. Cherylene Lee's narrator tells how her brother came to be a flame diver despite their overprotective parents' disapproval and muses that "Perhaps there is a Chinese gene encoded with a protein for caution." <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A-Z of Needlepoint (A-Z of Needlecraft)</h2><p>The book encompasses 65 stitches, including the most popular and commonly known, cross stitch and tent stitch, with easy to follow instructions and over 1200 step-by-step photographs.

Whether it&#x2019;s Marie-Antoinette&#x2019;s boudoir, the wings of the Queen&#x2019;s theater, or even the Orangerie on a beautiful wintery day, these singular photographs reveal the many facets of Versailles and offer readers unprecedented access to this historical treasure.</p><p>Francis Hammond&#x2019;s photographs have been published in Mariage Frï¿½res French Tea (2003) and Elegant Entertaining (2009) and in lifestyle magazines such as Elle Dï¿½cor and Martha Stewart Living. Bï¿½atrix Saule is chief curator and director of the research center at the Chï¿½teau de Versailles."Hammond was given complete freedom to walk the halls and grounds of Versailles sans crowds, capturing not only the grand rooms of the palace, like Marie Antoinette&#x2019;s boudoir and the Salon d&#x2019;Aurore, but <b>also intimate detail shots of architectural ornamentation and objects throughout the palace&#x2014;some of which are not on view to the public</b>.

The story begins with the massacre of the 11,000 strong Hicks Pasha column in 1883. Sent to evacuate the country, British hero General Gordon was surrounded and murdered in Khartoum by an army of dervishes led by the Mahdi. The relief mission arrived 2 days too late. The result was a national scandal that shocked the Queen and led to the fall of the British government. Twelve years later it was the brilliant Herbert Kitchener who struck back. Achieving the impossible he built a railway across the desert to transport his troops to the final devastating confrontation at Omdurman in 1898. Desert explorer and author Michael Asher has reconstructed this classic tale in vivid detail. Having covered every inch of the ground and examined all eyewitness reports, he brings to bear new evidence questioning several accepted aspects of the story. The result is an account that sheds new light on the most riveting tale of honour, courage, revenge and savagery of late Victorian times.</p><p><b>Michael Asher </b>is one of Britain's most prominent desert explorers.

They're long and thin and splay toed, with buttons of yellow callus on the little toes and a thick stair-step of it on the back of the heel, and a few long black hairs are curling out of the skin at the tops of the feet, and the red nail polish is cracking and peeling in curls and candy-striped with decay. Lenore only notices because Mindy's bent over in the chair by the fridge picking at some of the polish on her toes; her bathrobe's opening a little, so there's some cleavage visible and everything, a lot more than Lenore's got, and the thick white towel wrapped around Mindy's wet washed shampooed head is coming undone and a wisp of dark shiny hair has slithered out of a crack in the folds and curled down all demurely past the side of Mindy's face and under her chin. It smells like Flex shampoo in the room, and also pot, since Clarice and Sue Shaw are smoking a big thick j-bird Lenore got from Ed Creamer back at Shaker School and brought up with some other stuff for Clarice, here at school.</p><p>What's going on is that Lenore Beadsman, who's fifteen, has just come all the way from home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, right near Cleveland, to visit her big sister, Clarice Beadsman, who's a fresh man at this women's college, called Mount Holyoke; and Lenore's staying with her sleeping bag in this room on the second floor of Rumpus Hall that Clarice shares with her roommates, Mindy Metal man and Sue Shaw. Lenore's also come to sort of check out this college, a little bit. This is because even though she's just fifteen she's supposedly quite intelligent and thus acceleratedand already a junior at Shaker School and thus thinking about college, application-wise, for next year. So she's visiting. Right now it's a Friday night in March.</p><p>Sue Shaw, who's not nearly as pretty as Mindy or Clarice, is bringing the joint over here to Mindy and Lenore, and Mindy takes it and lets her toe alone for a second and sucks the bird really hard, so it glows bright and a seed snaps loudly and bits of paper ash go flying and floating, which Clarice and Sue find super funny and start laughing at really hard, whooping and clutching at each other, and Mindy breathes it in really deep and holds it in and passes the bird to Lenore, but Lenore says no thank you.</p><p>"No thank you," says Lenore.</p><p>"Go ahead, you brought it, why not . . . ," croaks Mindy Metal man, talking the way people talk without breathing, holding on to the smoke.</p><p>"I know, but it's track season at school and I'm on the team and I don't smoke during the season, I can't, it kills me," Lenore says.</p><p>So Mindy shrugs and finally lets out a big breath of pale used-up smoke and coughs a deep little cough and gets up with the bird and takes it over across the room to Clarice and Sue Shaw, who are by a big wooden stereo speaker listening to this song, again, by Cat Stevens, for like the tenth time tonight. Mindy's robe's more or less open, now, and Lenore can see some pretty amazing stuff, but Mindy just walks across the room. Lenore can at this point divide all the girls she's known neatly into girls who think deep down they're pretty and girls who deep down think they're really not. Girls who think they're pretty don't care much about their bathrobes being undone and are good at makeup and like to walk when people are watching, and they act different when there are boys around; and girls like Lenore, who don't think they're too pretty, tend not to wear makeup, and run track, and wear black Converse sneakers, and keep their bathrobes pretty well fastened at all times. Mindy sure is pretty, though, except for her feet.</p><p>The Cat Stevens song is over again, and the needle goes up by itself, and obviously none of these three feel like moving all the way to start it again, so they're just sitting back in their hard wood desk chairs, Mindy in her faded pink terry robe with one shiny smooth leg all bare and sticking out; Clarice in her Desert boots and her dark blue jeans that Lenore calls her shoe-horn jeans, and that white western shirt she'd wore at the state fair the time she'd had her purse stolen, and her blond hair flooding all over the shirt, and her eyes very blue right now; Sue Shaw with her red hair and a green sweater and green tartan skirt and fat white legs with a bright red pimple just over one knee, legs crossed with one foot jiggling one of those boat shoes, with the sick white soles--Lenore dislikes that kind of shoe a lot.Clarice after a quiet bit lets out a long sigh and says, in whispers, "Cat . . . is . . . God," giggling a little at the end. The other two giggle too.</p><p>"God? How can Cat be God? Cat exists." Mindy's eyes are all red.</p><p>"That's offensive and completely blasphemous," says Sue Shaw, eyes wide and puffed and indignant.</p><p>"Blasphemous?" Clarice dies, looks at Lenore. "Blasphemous," she says. Her eyes aren't all that bad, really, just unusually cheerful, as if she's got a joke she's not telling.</p><p>"Blissphemous," says Mindy.<br>"Blossphemous. "<br>"Blousephemous. "<br>"Bluesphemous. "<br>"Boisterous. "<br>"Boisteronahalfshell. "<br>"Bucephalus. "<br>"Bamey Rubble."<br>"Baba Yaga."<br>"Bolshevik. "<br>"Blaphemous!"</p><p>They're dying, doubled over, and Lenore's laughing that weird sympathetic laugh you laugh when everybody else is laughing so hard they make you laugh too. The noise of the big party downstairs is coming through the floor and vibrating in Lenore's black sneakers and the arms of the chair. Now Mindy slides out of her desk chair all limp and shlomps down on Lenore's sleeping bag on the floor next to Clarice's pretend-Persian ruglet from Mooradian's in Cleveland, and Mindy modestly covers her crotch with a comer of her robe, but Lenore still can't help but see the way her breasts swell up into the worn pink towel cloth of the robe, all full and stuff, even lying down on her back, there, on the floor. Lenore unconsciously looks down a little at her own chest, under her flannel shirt.</p><p>"Hunger," Sue Shaw says after a minute. "Massive, immense, uncontrollable, consuming, uncontrollable, hunger."</p><p>"This is so," says Mindy.</p><p>"We will wait"--Clarice looks at her watch on the underside of her wrist--"one, that is one hour, before eating anything what soentirelyever."</p><p>"No we can't possibly possibly do that."</p><p>"But do it we shall. As per room discussions of not one week ago, when we explicitly agreed that we shall not gorge when utterly flapped, lest we get fat and repulsive, like Mindy, over there, you poor midge."</p><p>"Fart-blossom," Mindy says absently, she's not fat and she knows it, Lenore knows it, they all know it.</p><p>"A lady at all times, that Metalman," Clarice says. Then a minute, "Speaking of which, you might just maybe either fix your robe or get dressed or get up off your back in Lenore's stuff, I'm not really all up for giving you a gynecological exam, which is sort of what you're making us do, here, O Lesbia of Thebes."</p><p>"Stuff and bother," says Mindy, or rather, "Stuth and bozzer"; and she gets up swaying and reaching for solid things, goes over to the door that goes into her little single bedroom off the bathroom. She got there first in September and took it, Clarice had said in a letter, this Playboy-Playmatish JAP from Scarsdale, and she's shedding what's left of her bathrobe, battered into submission, leaving it all wet in Lenore's lap in the chair by the door, and going through the door with her long legs, deliberate steps. Shuts the door.</p></p><h2>Harcourt School Publishers Horizons: Student Edition Us History 2003</h2><p>American History - From the early beginnings to the end of the Twentieth Century.

Time has shown that those declarations&#x2015;at least in terms of progress and prosperity&#x2015;were premature by several decades. Life for an Alabama tenant farmer in 1920 did not differ significantly from the life his grandfather led fifty years earlier. In fact, the South remained primarily a land of poor farming folks until the 1940s. Only then, and after World War II, did the real New South of industrial growth and urban development begin to emerge. Jack Temple Kirby&#x2019;s massive and engaging study examines the rural southern world of the first half of this century, its collapse, and the resulting &#x201c;modernization&#x201d; of southern society. The American South was the last region of the Western world to undergo this process, and <i>Rural Worlds Lost </i>is the first book to so thoroughly assess the profound changes modernization has wrought.</p><p>Kirby painstakingly charts the structural changes in agriculture that have occurred in the South and the effects these changes have had on people both at work and in the community. He is quick to note that there is not just one South but many, emphasizing the South&#x2019;s diversity not only in terms of race but also in terms of crop type and topography, and the resultant cultural differences of various areas of the region. He also skillfully compares southern life and institutions with those in other parts of the country, noting discrepancies and similarities.</p><p>Perhaps even more significant, however, is Kirby&#x2019;s focus on the lives and communities of ordinary people and how they have been transformed by the effects of modernization. By using the oral histories collected by WPA interviewers, Kirby shows firsthand how rural southerners lived in the 1930s and what forces shaped their views on life. He assesses the impact of cash upon traditional rural economies, the revolutionary effects of New Deal programs on the rich and poor, and the forms and cultural results of migration. Kirby also treats home life, recording attitudes toward marriage, and sex, health maintenance, and class relationships, not to mention sports and leisure, moonshining, and the southerner&#x2019;s longstanding love-hate relationship with the mule.</p><p><i>Rural Worlds Lost</i>, based on exceptionally extensive research in archives throughout the South and in federal agricultural censuses, definitively charts the enormous changes that have taken place in the South in this century. Writing about Kirby&#x2019;s previous book, <i>Media-Made Dixie,</i> <i>Time Magazine</i> noted Kirby&#x2019;s &#x201c;scholarship of rare lucidity.&#x201d; That same high level of scholarship, as well as an undeniable affection for the region, is abundantly evident in this new, path-breaking book.</p></p><p>Jack Temple Kirby is professor of history at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.Kirby's book is an impressive scholarly study and analysis of the collapse of the rural South, its economic systems and ways of life, and the resulting modernization of Southern society. It took Kirby seven years to research the book, and he traveled some twenty thousand miles, from Washington, D.C., to Texas, collecting data. He deals thoroughly with three aspects of the South's transformation: structural change in agriculture, the effects of structural change at work and in the communities, and rural-urban migration. Kirby's methodology and research make the book a welcome addition to Southern literature. Recommended for academic and research libraries. Ron Chepesiuk, Winthrop Coll.

The McCarthy era has been studied for years, and although we may know the basic stories of how careers were ruined by accusations and innuendo, hearing the stories from the participants themselves is very moving. Interviewees range from people whose careers eventually rebounded, such as Martin Ritt, Walter Bernstein, and Ring Lardner Jr., to people who never again worked as writers or actors.Praise for <i>Tender Comrades</i>:<p> "An acute portrait of that squalid time when the witch-hunt was on in Hollywood and of the thirty-six movie artists interviewed here who were deprived of a livelihood--even as hundreds of others lived in fear of the House Un-American Activities Committee--while havoc was strewn through their lives and their professions." --Norman Mailer</p><p> "This is not the usual book of remembrances--nostalgic, bittersweet, and all that. This is chapter-and-verse recall of our country's most shameful epoch....It is eloquent and revelatory, but most of all, it is a cautionary tale." --Studs Terkel</p><p> "Everybody in America should be entitled to their opinions, and in <i>Tender Comrades</i>, a rich, hefty book[,] we get plenty....McGilligan is the preeminent historian of Hollywood writers." --<i>The Village Voice</i></p><p> "A rich compendium of Hollywood reminiscences...[It] provides the collective oral history of an unscrupulous industry's ethnic cleansing." --<i>The Texas Observer</i></p></p><h2>White Women, Black Men: Illicit Sex in the Nineteenth-Century South</h2><p>This book is the first to explore the history of a powerful category of illicit sex in America&#x2019;s past: liaisons between Southern white women and black men. Martha Hodes tells a series of stories about such liaisons in the years before the Civil War, explores the complex ways in which white Southerners tolerated them in the slave South, and shows how and why these responses changed with emancipation. <br><br>Hodes provides details of the wedding of a white servant-woman and a slave man in 1681, an antebellum rape accusation that uncovered a relationship between an unmarried white woman and a slave, and a divorce plea from a white farmer based on an adulterous affair between his wife and a neighborhood slave. Drawing on sources that include courtroom testimony, legislative petitions, pardon pleas, and congressional testimony, she presents the voices of the authorities, eyewitnesses, and the transgressors themselves&#x2015;and these voices seem to say that in the slave South, whites were not overwhelmingly concerned about such liaisons, beyond the racial and legal status of the children that were produced. Only with the advent of black freedom did the issue move beyond neighborhood dramas and into the arena of politics, becoming a much more serious taboo than it had ever been before. Hodes gives vivid examples of the violence that followed the upheaval of war, when black men and white women were targeted by the Ku Klux Klan and unprecedented white rage and terrorism against such liaisons began to erupt. An era of terror and lynchings was inaugurated, and the legacy of these sexual politics lingered well into the twentieth century.</p><p><i>White Women, Black Men</i> is a fascinating study of a category of interracial relationships that conventional wisdom has held did not exist: liaisons (the term author Martha Hodes prefers) between black men and white women in the antebellum South. Hodes shows how such relationships were tolerated, though not encouraged, to a surprising degree before the Civil War. In a fascinating feat of historical detective work, she uses court documents and other records in cases involving racial status, rape, divorce, and property, to explore the nature of these relationships. She shows white women who voluntarily gave up their privileged status to cohabit with black men, and white communities that turned a blind eye toward such unions. It was not until after the Civil War--when freedom for blacks meant Southern whites needed new ways to enforce their putative superiority--that black men were routinely punished with violence for real, or imagined, relationships with white women.<b>Martha Hodes </b>is assistant professor of history at New York University.</p><h2>Science Explorer Life Science (GA)</h2><p>Prentice Hall Science Explorer Georgia Life Science [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Confederacy of Dunces</h2><p>The ordinary folk of New Orleans seem to think he is unhinged as well. Ignatius ignores them as he heaves his vast bulk through the city&#39;s fleshpots in a noble crusade against vice, modernity and ignorance. But his momma has a nasty surprise in store for him. Ignatius must get a job. Undaunted, he uses his new-found employment to further his mission and now he has a pirate costume and a hot-dog cart to do it with.</p><p><i>"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."</i><p> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. </p><p> Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>When Walker Percy penned these prophetic words in his foreword to the first edition of A Confederacy of Dunces, he could not have known just how wide Toole's "world of readers" would become. Released by Louisiana State University Press in April 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Turned down by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today, there are over 1,500,000 copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages.<p>Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Percy dubs "slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one -- who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age". Ignatius' ire explodes when his mother backs her car into another automobile. The owner of the damaged vehicle insists on payment; Mrs. Reilly demands that her son cease watching television and writing in his Big Chief tablet and get a job.</p><p>Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presences -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levy Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses. Satire and farce animate A Confederacy of Dunces; tragic awareness ennobles it.</p><p>Louisiana State University Press celebrates A Confederacy of Dunces' twentieth year withthis anniversary edition, which includes a new introduction by Andrei Codrescu that examines the relationship of this modern-day classic to the city whose pulse it so brilliantly captures.</p></p><h2>Jamie&#39;s Food Tube the Cake Book: Seasonal Baking With Cupcake Jemma</h2><p>Jamie Oliver's Food Tube presents The Cake Book, a collection of 50 deliciously inventive and exciting cake and cupcake recipes from Food Tube's own Cupcake Jemma.

By the time we arrived, the number of missions had increased to fifty. The mortality rate was so high that they just couldn&#39;t bring in new crews fast enough . . . Fifty missions is an unbelievable worth calculating. This is the remarkable true story of Joseph Banks, a young Latter-day Saint and lone survivor of his plane that was shot down during a dangerous bombing run over Germany on his 49th mission-one mission away from going home. A prisoner of war, Joseph overcame impossible odds to mount a miraculous escape and return safely to his wife and young son.

Along with a series of well-tested recipes (including a cocktail called the Lucky Jim) the book includes Amis&#39;s musings on The Hangover, The Boozing Man&#39;s Diet, The Mean Sod&#39;s Guide, and (presumably as a matter of speculation) How Not to Get Drunk-all leavened with fun quizzes on the making and drinking of alcohol all over the world. Mixing practical know-how and hilarious opinionation, this is a delightful cocktail of wry humor and distilled knowledge, served by one of our great gimlet wits.</p><p><p>Kingsley Amis was one of the best-respected British novelists of the mid-20th century. He was the author of more than 20 novels, including the classic Lucky Jim. He died in 1995 at the age of 73.</p>The drinks revival is nearly complete&#x2014;it&#x2019;s now possible to be as insufferable about beer and spirits as about wine&#x2014;but the revival seems to come with a warning label: enjoy the drinks, but don&#x2019;t drink too much. In the face of that, it&#x2019;s refreshing to see an artifact from a more hedonistic era: Amis knew the finer points of booze as well as anyone, but he never apologized for enjoying its effect, either. This reissue, appropriately introduced by Christopher Hitchens, collects Amis&#x2019; three drinks books: On Drink (1973), an indispensable primer; Every Day Drinking (1983), a browseworthy collection of newspaper columns; and How&#x2019;s Your Glass? (1984), a dispensable collection of quizzes. Some of the advice is timeless&#x2014;Amis, who could presumably afford better, advocated strategic deployment of cheap booze to save money&#x2014;and some is not: liquor-store shelves look so different now that some passages are best read for historical perspective. But good humor never spoils, and Amis&#x2019; quips and gripes about noisy pubs, vodka drinkers, wine snobs, teetotalers, and hangovers grow more delicious with age. --Keir Graff</p><h2>Herb Drying Handbook: Includes Complete Microwave Drying Instructions</h2><p>Demonstrated harvesting and drying techniques, and describes the characteristcs and uses of more than sixty herbs</p><p></p><h2>Chazown: Define Your Vision.

Sashenka, a headstrong and self-centered teenage girl, resents her mother for taking a lover after her father&#x2019;s death in the war, and denounces her to the authorities for the petty theft that keeps them from going hungry. When she meets a Jewish lieutenant who has returned to bury his family, betrayed and murdered by their neighbors during the occupation, both must come to terms with the trauma that surrounds them as their relationship deepens.<br><br><i>Redemption</i> is a stark and powerful portrait of humanity caught up in Stalin&#x2019;s police state in the aftermath of the war and the Holocaust. In this short novel, written in 1967 but unpublished for many years, Friedrich Gorenstein effortlessly combines the concrete details of daily life in this devastated society with witness testimonies to the mass murder of Jews. He gives a realistic account of postwar Soviet suffering through nuanced psychological portraits of people confronted with harsh choices and a coming-of-age story underscored by the deep involvement of sexuality and violence. Interspersed are flights of philosophical consideration of the relationship between Christians and Jews, love and suffering, justice and forgiveness. A major addition to the canon of literature bearing witness to the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, <i>Redemption</i> is an important reckoning with anti-Semitism and Stalinist repression from a significant Soviet Jewish voice.</p><p>Friedrich Gorenstein (1932&#x2013;2002), born in Kiev, was a Soviet Jewish writer and screenwriter who collaborated with Andrei Tarkovsky on <i>Solaris </i>(1972), among other works. His father was arrested during Stalin&#x2019;s purges and later shot. Unable to publish in the Soviet Union, Gorenstein emigrated to Berlin, where he lived until his death. An award-winning film adaptation of <i>Redemption</i> was released in 2012.<br><br>Andrew Bromfield is an acclaimed translator of contemporary Russian writers such as Victor Pelevin and Boris Akunin. He has also translated Leo Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>War and Peace.</i><i>Redemption</i> is awash with brutal truths, rude awakenings and painful self-discoveries. Gorenstein doesn't make it easy for his reader: His forbidding theme is the aftermath of the Holocaust &#x2015; the aftershock of 'ineluctable, planned murder' &#x2015; and his protagonist is an unsympathetic young woman. But the darkness is not total; there are numerous glints of light, even pockets of beauty. Gorenstein skillfully crafts scenes, paints landscapes and conveys moods. We move from the shabby elegance of the ball to the snowy streets with their burned-out ruins. We watch with morbid fascination as Sashenka inflicts damage on others and then herself. Punctuating her many trials and errors are searching meditations on suffering and salvation, love and fate. (Malcolm Forbes <i>Star Tribune</i>)<br><br>Set immediately after World War II in a Soviet town emerging from German occupation, Friedrich Gorenstein&#x2019;s <i>Redemption</i> is a small masterpiece of post-Holocaust fiction. Vividly translated by Andrew Bromfield, this is a gripping book&#x2015;full of searing psychological portraits threaded across intersecting social, political, and historical microcosms. <i>Redemption</i> startles the reader with its emotionally and philosophically vivid account of sex and violence and the strange horizons of love. (Val Vinokur, The New School)<br><br>Bromfield&#x2019;s translation of Gorenstein&#x2019;s <i>Redemption</i> peels away the layers of the still underexamined archive of the Holocaust in the USSR. In the immediate aftermath of the war with Nazi Germany, denizens of a town in Soviet Ukraine begin to face the consequences of the wartime treatment of their Jewish neighbors. Official documents and witness reports crowd in on personal recollections of perpetrators, survivors, and their progeny in a narrative that shifts between stylistic registers as it challenges the contours of collective memory and individual responsibility. I&#x2019;m thrilled that this work by an important Russian author is now available to the English-language reader. (Sasha Senderovich, University of Washington, Seattle)<br><br>A master of episodic narration. . . . Gorenstein also proves to be a keen observer and radically critical chronicler of Soviet society. (Heinz Ludwig Arnold, <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>)<br><br>Told honestly but philosophically, this is the story of two young people&#x2019;s love in the aftermath of World War II, as some traumas were healing and others were only beginning, laying bare the underacknowledged Holocaust in the USSR. (<i>World Literature Today</i>)<br><br>The cast of <i>Redemption</i> is destitute, traumatized, and beset by a restless police apparatus hunting out wartime collaborators. They are constitutionally unfit to bring new life into the world &#x2015; yet they do: securing food and heat, having parties, making babies, and burying the dead. All of it, the book argues, is the result of ineluctable forces &#x2015; biological, tectonic, geothermal &#x2015; rather than proof of any spiritual or ideological purpose. The countless victims of the war have not been redeemed by the living; their murders won&#x2019;t be paid back. Indeed, the novel&#x2019;s beauty and its truth rest on the knowledge that redemption is inconceivable and that life persists in its absence. (Leeore Schnairsohn <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Friedrich Gorenstein (1932-2002) is a major figure in the history of 20th-century Russian literature&#x2015;and a most curious one. On the one hand, his novels blend fiction with religion, philosophy, and politics in a way that is quintessentially Russian, reminiscent of writers from Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy to Chekhov and, in the 20th century, Andrei Platonov. On the other hand, throughout his voluminous body of work, he defiantly tackles those selfsame issues as a Jewish writer, a Jewish thinker, and an uncompromising Jewish voice. . . . The power of Gorenstein&#x2019;s writing lies in the fact that his weighty, nuanced, and idiosyncratic political and religious imagination is channeled through a spellbinding lyrical style.

Howard Fine is the illustrator of many fine pig picture books, including Piggie Pie!, A Piggie Christmas, and Piggie&#39;s Twelve Days of Christmas. He is also the illustrator of Zoom Broom and Broom Mates. Howard Fine lives with his wife and three children in Westchester County, New York.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 3-"In Sooey, South Dakota,/in a sloppy, stuffy sty,/there's an itchy ol' straw bed/where the Bed Hogs pile high." Little Runt is squished, squashed, and buried beneath his siblings and his parents and he's had enough. One by one, he kicks each family member out of bed-Rose, "the reigning beauty queen," who has smelly feet; Flo, who drools in her sleep; "big, blue-ribbon Ed," who giggles when he dreams; Mama, who dances while she snoozes; and snoring Papa. However, when Little Runt has the bed all to himself, he realizes that he's cold, scared, and lonesome. He invites everyone to pile back in and then he feels much better. Told in lilting verses, this story will tickle young readers. The hog-wild illustrations expand the laughter generated by the text, and the rosy palette adds warmth to the pages. Each pig exudes personality; Mama sports pearls and glasses and Rose wears a banner reading "Miss USDA." Youngsters may recognize this hog family as cousins to the characters Fine created for Margie Palatini's Piggie Pie! (Houghton, 1995).

She has published fiction and criticism in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Partisan Review</i>, <i>Commentary</i>, and <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>.<b>From Elizabeth Dalton's Introduction <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales</i></b> <p>Originally intended for adults, the <i>Kinder- und Hausmï¿½rchen (Children&#x2019;s and Household Stories)</i> of the Brothers Grimm has become not only the world&#x2019;s most important collection of folk and fairy tales, but also the central work in the literary culture of childhood. Paradoxically, the tales have been criticized ever since they first appeared as inappropriate for children&#x2014;too frank about sex, too violent, too dark. The Grimms themselves began censoring the sex as they brought out successive editions, and subsequent editors and translators have continued the process, modifying the violence as well. But the darkness remains. </p><p>These tales of enchantment and ordeal contain terrifying encounters with witches, giants, and devouring beasts. Even the more benign tales usually involve suffering or danger: persecution by a cruel stepmother or abusive father, a battle with a demon, at the very least marriage to a hedgehog or some other strange creature. There are confrontations with death itself, as in &#x201c;The Three Snake-Leaves&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Godfather Death,&#x201d; and with the enchanted sleep that resembles it, as in &#x201c;The Glass Coffin&#x201d; and &#x201c;Briar Rose,&#x201d; the Sleeping Beauty story. Yet in spite of these dark and deathly elements, or perhaps even because of them, the Grimms&#x2019; tales have a compelling vitality. They are cruder, wilder, more violent, and more fun than the elegant and poignantly beautiful tales of the Grimms&#x2019; Danish contemporary Hans Christian Andersen. </p><p>Unlike Andersen, the Grimms did not invent new tales but collected old ones, with the intention of preserving the oral tradition of the German peasantry. Whether in fact they fulfilled that intention has been questioned. Their tales do afford a glimpse of a world of castles and forests, nobles and peasants, superstitious beliefs and primitive practices that suggest origins at least as old as feudal Europe, and often much older. Some of the tales have been traced back through the centuries by way of earlier versions until they disappear into prehistoric times. </p><p>Residues of the social and material conditions of the societies from which they came can be found in the tales, but transformed, as in a dream, by wish, fear, and fantasy. Indeed, the tales often have the strange logic, the freedom from the constraints of time and space, and the abrupt and violent actions that characterize dreams and that Freud attributed to what he called &#x201c;primary process,&#x201d; the kind of thinking that prevails in the unconscious and in childhood. The boundary between reality and fantasy is porous and unstable; everything, including inanimate objects, is alive and responds magically to wishes and fears. There are mysteries and secrets everywhere, as in the lives of children, who are kept in the dark about fundamental realities&#x2014;sex, death, money, and the whole complex mystery of their parents&#x2019; desires and disappointments. </p><p>The sense of mystery and the belief in the magical powers of thought never go away entirely, but live on in the adult unconscious, accounting for the inexhaustible appeal of fairy tales. They reappear continually in new forms, not only for children but as sophisticated works for adults, such as Jean Cocteau&#x2019;s classic film <i>La Belle et la Bï¿½te</i> (1946), Donald Barthelme&#x2019;s ironic postmodern novel <i>Snow White</i> (1967), the unconventional feminist fictions of Angela Carter, the Stephen Sondheim musical <i>Into the Woods</i> (1987), and so on. Most German writers who came after the Grimms tried sooner or later to write a fairy tale. Even the stories of Franz Kafka are like fairy tales gone wrong. The patterns of fantasy and the narrative structures of the tales apparently satisfy profound psychological and aesthetic needs, endlessly generating new versions. </p><p>Motifs from the Grimms&#x2019; tales also appear in older classic works of fiction and drama, including some that could not possibly have been influenced by them, such as Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays. In <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> (c. 1595), the riddle of the three caskets posed to the candidates for Portia&#x2019;s hand is like the &#x201c;wooer-tests&#x201d; in many tales. In <i>King Lear</i> (c. 1605), the old king demands from his daughter all her love, including that owed to a husband, like the incestuous king in the Grimms&#x2019; tale &#x201c;Allerleirauh&#x201d; (&#x201c;Many Furs&#x201d;). Lear&#x2019;s good and loving daughter, Cordelia, is persecuted, like Cinderella, by two wicked elder sisters. </p><p>The Cinderella pattern is perhaps the most widespread of all: The transformation of a poor and insignificant girl into a belle is the theme of innumerable novels, plays, and films. In Jane Austen&#x2019;s <i>Persuasion</i> (1818), for instance, Anne Elliot is treated like a servant by her hateful sisters, yet it is she who wins the love of the princely Captain Wentworth. Isabel Archer, in Henry James&#x2019;s <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> (1881), even has a fairy godmother&#x2014;as Charles Perrault&#x2019;s Cinderella does, although the Grimms&#x2019; does not&#x2014;a male one who leaves her a fortune, enabling her, ironically, to choose the poorest but worst of her canonical three suitors. This figure of the mysterious benefactor, like the dwarf in &#x201c;The Singing Bone,&#x201d; recurs frequently in the tales, and also in novels, especially those of Dickens&#x2014;Magwitch in <i>Great Expectations</i> (1860&#x2013;1861), for instance. Novels and plays differ from tales in many respects, notably in giving their characters rich inner lives, while in tales psychological conflicts are worked out in action. Nonetheless, the parallels at the level of plot between tales and the larger and more fully developed forms are striking and could make a very long list. It seems that the <i>Kinder- und Hausmï¿½rchen</i> form a great repository of narrative motifs that have circulated throughout Europe in various forms for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. How they made their way into the tales is only one of the many unresolved questions associated with the Grimms and their work. </p></p><h2>Dry Bones: A Novel</h2><p>As the Red Army continues its unstoppable march toward Berlin in the winter of 1945, Dunne and his fellow soldier Dick Van Hull volunteer for a dangerous drop behind enemy lines to rescue a team of OSS officers trying to abet the Czech resistance. When the plan goes south, Dunne and Van Hull uncover a secret that will change both of their lives. Years later, Dunne is drawn back into the shadowy realm of Cold War espionage in an effort to clear his friend&#39;s good name and right an injustice so shocking that men would, quite literally, kill to keep it quiet. A literary thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end, Dry Bones completes the trilogy started in Hour of the Cat. Peter Quinn has crafted yet another smart and stylish historical mystery, following his longtime hero from the last gasp of the Third Reich to the heady days of the Cuban revolution. Quinn&#39;s signature prose--which Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt described as &#34;spare but passionate, wry but loving&#34;--shines once again throughout. New York Times bestselling author James Patterson credits Quinn with &#34;perfecting, if not actually creating, a genre you could call the history-mystery.&#34; Blending fact and fiction into a thoroughly compelling whole, this is Quinn at his very best.</p><p>Peter Quinn is the author of Hour of the Cat, The Man Who Never Returned, Looking for Jimmy, and The Banished Children of Eve."Quinn's plot defy easy summary, but his characters fascinate, and his sense of place and time is compelling.

Dunne can be misled and mishandled, but he can&#x2019;t be deterred. Every bit as unpredictable as Quinn&#x2019;s first two installments, this riveting conclusion to the trilogy leaves no doubt that Dunne is an ace of Spades who knows when to hold &#x2018;em and when to fold &#x2018;em.&#x201d; &#x2013; William Kennedy<br><br>"Peter Quinn is a poet and an historian and one of our finest storytellers.&nbsp; He sits at the fireside of the American imagination.&nbsp; He can carve mystery out of mystery.&nbsp; The work is generous and agile and profound."&nbsp;&nbsp; - Colum McCann, National Book Award winner and author of <i>Transatlantic</i>.<br><br>Praise for Peter Quinn:<br><br>"Quinn knows New York and its politics better than anyone.

Lukacs describes how the German dictator tried to force the British into a compromise peace, explains why Hitler declined to destroy the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk and reveals in detail how Churchill succeeded in keeping up the fighting morale of Britain as it stood alone after the fall of France. In this masterful double-portrait Hitler is presented as a "revolutionary" and Churchill as a "reactionary," the incarnation of the resistance of the old world to "a force that was frighteningly efficient, brutal, and new." The author leaves no doubt that Churchill had a much greater understanding of his adversary than did Hitler. The third great character in the study is Franklin Roosevelt. Lukacs ( The Last European War ) analyzes the influence of the powerful isolationist bloc in the U.S. and distills the factors that led FDR to defy it, bypass Congress and order the transfer of 50 destroyers to Britain--the first formal American departure from neutrality. The book is a significant contribution to our understanding of WW II. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This extended essay presents the confrontation between Hitler and Churchill in the summer of 1940 as the pivotal event of World War II, and of modern European history. Lukacs ( Budapest: Nineteen Hundred ) powerfully contrasts Hitler the revolutionary with Churchill the statesman. One championed a new order, a world "heroic, pagan, and scientific." The other defended the values of Western civilization. Churchill fought on against seemingly hopeless odds. Hitler refused to risk the invasion Lukacs believes might have won the war. Stalemated, each duelist sought an alternate solution. Hitler turned against the Soviet Union; Churchill turned toward the United States. The immediate result was Europe's eclipse, and 40 years of U.S./USSR occupation. But Europe survived, and in the long run it was the traditionalist who triumphed over the radical--a triumph highlighted by the events of 1990.

In this companion volume to McGilligan&#39;s widely praised Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age, fourteen studio scribes active in later decades rail and reminisce about their fifty-plus years of inventing and scripting movies. Richard Brooks, Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, Arthur Laurents, Ben Maddow, Stewart Stern, Daniel Taradash, and Philip Yordan are among the distinguished figures included. The 1940s were a period of transition for the motion picture industry, from an era of hope and glory and the upheavals of World War II to a postwar era of caution and confusion. The 1950s brought a great decline in the number of films produced and led to the extinction of that peculiar creature, the contract writer. The survivors of Hollywood&#39;s most productive years remain wonderfully talkative, however. In this lively collection of interviews they contribute useful writing tips, radical correctives to screen history and industry folklore, and just plain fascinating gossip. As a whole, the interviews provide a compelling biographical close-up of an entire generation of men and women whose talent, vision, and tenacity were critical to the institution we know as &#34;Hollywood.&#34;</p><p><i>Backstory 2</i>, the second volume of interviews with Hollywood's legendary screenwriters, covers those who thrived in the 1940s and '50s. It was a tumultuous period for the film industry, a time often referred to as Hollywood's golden age, even though it was also the era of the blacklist. Scenarists were hit particularly hard by McCarthyism: eight of the famous "Hollywood Ten" were writers. The focus of this rich volume is aptly summarized in the introduction by editor Patrick McGilligan: "There are updates on the studios and the chieftains of the 1940s and '50s; vignettes of directors (like [George] Cukor) who respected the script and others (like [Howard] Hawks) who fiddled with it; glimpses and anecdotes of eminent colleagues, including an assortment of tales about Faulkner, insights into the tricks, traps, and technology of films; philosophy about the illusions and realities of the craft."Pat McGilligan writes regularly for American Film, Film Comment, Film Quarterly, and Sight and Sound. His books include a definitive biography, Cagney: The Actor as Auteur, and notable biographies of directors Robert Altman and George Cukor.</p><h2>Aesthetic Theory (Bloomsbury Revelations)</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p>Theodor W. Adorno (1903-69) was a founder and arguably the foremost thinker of the Frankfurt School. He worked with Max Horkheimer at the New York Institute for Social Research and later taught at the University of Frankfurt until his death in 1969. His work has proved enormously influential in sociology, philosophy and cultural theory.&#34;...the fact that they [Continuum] are putting low price tags on works once published in expensive academic editions is something of which we can all be glad..&#34; -Modern Painters, 2/05</p><h2>Ike the Soldier</h2><p>Based on interviews with Dwight D. Eisenhower&#39;s closest associates, this biography follows Ike from his Kansas childhood to his station as Supreme Allied Commander during World War II</p><p>By the late author of Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman, this 896-page volume explores the kind of man Eisenhower was and how he developed as he did. Working with newly mined anecdotes and unpublished papers, Miller concentrates on the formation of Ike's character in his youth and then shows him in action. Brought into focus are his strained relationships with his father, his brothers, his son (John Eisenhower: "I think sometimes he considered me a sign that West Point had gone to hell") and, in particular, his by no means placid marriage. His relationship with Kay Summersby, his wartime driver-companion-confidante, is gone into in more detail than elsewhere. Miller takes pains to explain that there is no evidence to support Truman's Plain Speaking statement that Ike considered divorcing Mamie during the war. This is a highly enjoyable look at Ike's personal and official relationships with the people most important to him during the first 55 years of his life, including family, Army and Allied colleagues and heads of state. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is not a study of Eisenhower's ability as a general, nor is it a critical biography. It is, instead, a paean to Eisenhower by Miller, who idolized him. Beginning with his years at West Point, it follows his career as a junior officer, husband, father, and finally Supreme Commander in Europe. For his lengthy tribute Miller interviewed hundreds of people who knew the general. He read diaries, letters, manuscripts, the authors of which appear all to be favorably disposed. One becomes bored with so much adulation, even for those of us who like Ike. There is nothing new here, but public libraries should expect requests.

He identifies and illumines the true meaning behind Christmas, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and Michaelmas, emphasizing their inner spiritual and outer cosmic aspects. <br><br> Steiner shows that the festivals do not only commemorate great historical events and truths of the Christian tradition; they are in themselves&#x2015;each year&#x2015;spiritual events that manifest in seasonal and natural rhythms and carry a significance that grows and deepens with the development of human evolution.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Get Us Out of Here</h2><p>Maria Simma speaks with Nicky Eltz. &#34;Dear reader, What you are now holding is a most interesting book. The world beyond is speaking. It is offering advice, asking for help, and giving answers. It exists and speaks about life - our life here and of possible consequences of our behavior. It tells us that it is not the same to be humble, loving, good, merciful, loyal and honest as it is to be proud, loveless, bad, merciless, betraying and dishonest. At death this is not forgotten but rather remembered in total clarity.

Going beyond the basic definitions of kairos and chronos, Dutch brings fresh insight to the subject, examining Scripture to show how kairos (strategic) times and chronos (general) times are not two separate and unrelated seasons in our lives but rather, are often simply different phases of the same process. Dutch looks at how God brought about His divine shift in the lives of men and women throughout the Bible, and the many ways in which God used these seasons of change to deepen His people&#39;s understanding of Him.</p><p>God has a wonderful destiny for every life, but many Christians will die never having realized all that God has for them.

The sumptuous full-color photographs are advertisement-quality, and sometimes the text reads like a sales catalog, although no prices are given. Still, there is enough information to spark interest in would-be collectors, and a helpful glossary will help those researching single pieces they inherited. The volume on costume jewelry is one of those "introductions to appreciation" that is so well written and produced that it may very well inspire people to take a second look at their "junk" jewelry. Gorgeous, full-color photographs of more than 200 necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and brooches show stylistic details. Many are one-of-a-kind marked pieces most readers will admire here but never be able to buy, but the authors do succeed in describing characteristics of styles from the 18th-century through the present to help readers choose a favorite period to collect. Again, no prices are provided, but tips on collecting, care, and repairs and a glossary are included. Both books are excellent introductions to their topics at a good price; especially recommended for public or small libraries and as supplements to larger collections.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

This book is the result-an effort to picture that life truly and realistically. It is the story of an energetic and capable girl, the child of German immigrant parents, who at the age of seventeen married a young German farmer, and moved to a homestead on the wind-swept plains of Kansas, where she reared eleven of her twelve children, and remembering regretfully her own half-day in school, sent nine of them through college. It is a story of grim and tenacious devotion in the face of hardships and disappointments, devotion that never flagged until the long, hard task of near a lifetime was done.&#34;-John Ise (from the preface) Deeply moved by his mother&#39;s memories of a waning era and rapidly disappearing lifestyle, John Ise painstakingly recorded the adventures and adversities of his family and boyhood neighbors-the early homesteaders of Osborne County, Kansas. First published in 1936, his &#34;nonfiction novel&#34; Sod and Stubble has since become a widely read and much loved classic. In the original, Ise changed some identities and time sequences but accurately retained the uplifting and disheartening realities of prairie life. Von Rothenberger brings us a new annotated and expanded edition that greatly enhances Ise&#39;s timeless tale. He includes the entire first edition-replete with Ise&#39;s charm, wit, and veracity, restores four of Ise&#39;s original chapters that have never been published, and adds photographs of many of the key characters. In his notes, Rothenberger reveals the true identity of Ise&#39;s family and neighbors, provides background on their lives, and places events within a wider historical and geographical context.</p><p>"Over the years, I have recommended this book to hundreds of people in all walks of life and of almost all ages.

The Ford GT is the modern version of the incredible GT40, a car created by Ford in the 1960s to beat the Ferraris at Le Mans-which they did! The success of the original GT40, coupled with its great looks, made it one of the most popular cars in automotive racing history. Ford has revived the spirit of the original race car with perhaps its most exciting new car in 30 years-the Ford GT. The new car has lines taken straight off the original GT40 and power supplied by a 500-hp V-8. Three Ford GTs will be built in 2003 to commemorate the 1-2-3 victory at Le Mans in 1966, and the car will see limited regular production beginning in June 2004. This book includes an in-depth analysis of how the car came to be, complete with original interviews with Ford execs and engineers as well as drawings of concept cars. Also included is a short chapter summing up the origins and race history of the GT40. Also a section discussing the concepts for GT40 revivals. Many of these cars have not been revealed in publications previously.</p><p>Larry Edsall was snatched away from a career as the sports editor of a daily newspaper in Michigan to become the motorsports editor at <i>AutoWeek</i> magazine, where he spent most of a dozen years as the managing editor.

When NASA needed to land <i>Curiosity</i>&#x2014;a 2,000-pound, $2.5 billion rover&#x2014;on the surface of Mars, 140 million miles away, they turned to JPL. Steltzner&#x2019;s team couldn&#x2019;t test their kooky solution, the Sky Crane. They were on an unmissable deadline, and the world would be watching when they succeeded&#x2014;or failed.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the helm of this effort was an unlikely rocket scientist and accidental leader, Adam Steltzner. After barely graduating from high school, he followed his curiosity to the local community college to find out why the stars moved. Soon he discovered an astonishing gift for math and physics. After getting his Ph.D. he ensconced himself within JPL, NASA&#x2019;s decidedly unbureaucratic cousin, where success in a mission is the only metric that matters. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Right Kind of Crazy </i>is a first-person account of innovation that is relevant to anyï¿½one working in science, art, or technology. For instance, Steltzner describes:<br>&nbsp;<br>ï¿½How his team learned to switch from fear-based to curiosity-based decision making<br>ï¿½How to escape &#x201c;The Dark Room&#x201d;&#x2014;the creative block caused by fear, uncertainty, and the lack of a clear path forward<br>ï¿½How to tell when we&#x2019;re too in love with our own ideas to be objective about them&#x2014;and, conversely, when to fight for them<br>ï¿½How to foster mutual respect within teams while still bashing bad ideas<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Right Kind of Crazy </i>is a book for anyone who wants to channel their craziness into creativity, balance discord and harmony, and find a signal in a flood of noise.</p></p><p><b>ADAM STELTZNER</b> is an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He worked on several flight missions, including <i>Galileo, Cassini, </i>and <i>Mars Pathfinder, </i>and the Mars Exploration Rover project. He was the phase lead and development manager for the <i>Mars Science Laboratory </i>and the <i>Curiosity </i>rover&#x2019;s Entry, Descent, and Landing phase; he also helped design, build, and test the Sky Crane landing system. He lives in Pasadena, California.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>WILLIAM PATRICK</b> has cowritten memoirs by Sidney Poitier, Larry Flynt, Tamara Mellon, Robert Schuller, and Amy Robach<p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>SINATRA, AND A LOT OF BRASS</p><p>I&#x2019;m at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in the Cruise Mission Support Area, &#x201c;mission control,&#x201d; hooking up my iPhone to the Voice Operational Communications Assembly (VOCA), getting ready to launch Ol&#x2019; Blue Eyes singing Nelson Riddle&#x2019;s 1966 arrangement of &#x201c;All or Nothing at All.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s just before 8 p.m. on August 5, 2012, and we&#x2019;re nearing the climax of a massive team effort to land a rover the size of a MINI Cooper on Mars. The overall project, called <i>Mars Science Laboratory,</i> has taken ten years to reach this point. Before we&#x2019;re done tonight, we&#x2019;ll have set that rover down gently at our selected site, or we&#x2019;ll have made a smoking crater on the surface of Mars. Whichever way it goes, we won&#x2019;t even know for seven minutes. That&#x2019;s how long it takes data from Mars to reach us back on Earth.</p><p>Hunched over the desktop beside me, jamming his VOCA headset into the small iPhone speakers, is my good friend Miguel San Martin, who is also my deputy in managing our part of the project: the critical component known as Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).</p><p>The assignment we took on nearly a decade ago sounded straightforward enough: Design a way to deliver a 5,359-pound entry vehicle, which carries a 1,982-pound rover called <i>Curiosity,</i> into the Martian atmosphere without harm, then slow it down, guide it to the landing site, and put it down on the surface, safe and sound.</p><p>In just a couple of hours&#x2014;10:32 p.m. Pacific time&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll know how well we did. It&#x2019;s our all-or-nothing moment, the moment of truth.</p><p>As the engineer leading the EDL team, my main job tonight is to be on hand to accept praise or scorn on behalf of the team. Ours is perhaps the most treacherous part of this incredibly complex mission, and definitely the most visible. Like a flaming guitar solo in a stadium concert, EDL might not be the mission&#x2019;s most fundamental element but it is the part that everyone will remember, good or bad, the next day.</p><p>Thousands of people have spent a big hunk of their professional lives working fifty- to eighty-hour weeks on this mission; I have fifty colleagues in EDL alone. This is a complete team effort, and an effort of a truly remarkable team at that. But as my friend, mentor, and senior sage at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Gentry Lee, says, there has to be &#x201c;one ass to kick,&#x201d; and that ass is mine.</p><p>At JPL there&#x2019;s a long tradition of playing a &#x201c;wake up&#x201d; song at the start of every new day on Mars. Most of the choices have been bright and chipper, like &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Worry, Be Happy.&#x201d; But Mig and I are in charge tonight, and the music&#x2019;s our call. As is our custom, we&#x2019;ve tried to make a selection that speaks the truth of the situation we&#x2019;re in.</p><p>We flip the switch, and our little broadcast goes out through JPL&#x2019;s VOCA system to headsets all over the world. First comes some smooth and mellow brass&#x2014;trombones, I guess&#x2014;then a tease of muted trumpets, then more trombones, then another tease from the Hammond B-3, all riding atop that swinging drumbeat. And then the Voice with the Message: &#x201c;All&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or nothing at all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I take a moment to relish the sound, which is totally cinematic. You can see the helicopter shot over Mulholland Drive at sunset with the LA skyline below. Or maybe a &#x2019;57 T-bird pulling into the Sands in Vegas with Deano at the wheel and Sammy Davis Jr. riding shotgun. It&#x2019;s a skinny-tie, dry-martini arrangement, perfect for a caper like <i>Ocean&#x2019;s Eleven</i>&#x2014;the original, not the remake.</p><p>Listening alongside us in mission control are brass of another kind. The president of the California Institute of Technology is in the room, as is the head of JPL (which is an arm of Caltech), along with the head of NASA. Even the film director James Cameron is on hand to see what a real Mars landing looks like.</p><p>Since the space shuttle program was canceled in 2010, Mars has been the only game in town for NASA brass, and for space geeks this landing is the World Cup. A couple of large rooms manned by caterers and equipped with large fishbowl windows looking into the control room are filled with an assortment of governors and congressmen and other people wearing suits with flag lapel pins. At one point it looked as if the First Lady would attend, but something must have come up.</p><p>Our mission managers selected this date for the landing more than a year ago, based on celestial mechanics and the position of existing Mars orbiters that could photograph our descent and otherwise relay data. The rendezvous was set in motion last November, when the capsule carrying <i>Curiosity</i> was launched from the Kennedy Space Center aboard a $300 million Atlas V-51 rocket. This means that our spacecraft&#x2014;the product of almost a decade of many of our lives and the result of more than ten thousand human years of effort&#x2014;has been hurtling through interplanetary space toward the Red Planet at about 13,000 miles an hour for the past eight and a half months.</p><p>Getting a payload to Mars is hard. The target is anywhere from 40 million to 350 million miles away, depending on the alignment of the planets, and it&#x2019;s orbiting the sun at 24 kilometers a second, more than 50,000 miles per hour. Landing a rover full of delicate scientific instruments at a specific site&#x2014;in this case the Gale Crater, near Mount Sharp, in the northwestern corner of the Aeolis quadrangle&#x2014;and at precisely the right moment is harder still. Yet this was the objective of the team of engineers I had the privilege to lead.</p><p>The idiosyncrasies of Mars&#x2019;s dust-laden carbon dioxide atmosphere don&#x2019;t make the job any easier. The planet has one-third the gravity of Earth. Its atmosphere is so thin that the air offers little resistance to an object hurtling through it&#x2014;but is still thick enough to cause tremendous heating when you show up going 13,000-some-odd miles an hour. You&#x2019;ll need to come equipped with both an outsize parachute to slow you down&#x2014;one that can open while you&#x2019;re still going nearly twice the speed of sound&#x2014;and a heat shield to keep you from bursting into flames as you enter.</p><p>Once that heat shield gets you in, you need to blow it off with pyrotechnics so your radar can see the surface, and then you need the usual rocket thrusters to slow you further and guide your descent. We have been to Mars before, and we have always used this approach. But here&#x2019;s the bummer: The long-legged landers we used for the <i>Viking</i> missions to Mars in the &#x2019;70s could travel safely only to very flat places. We wanted <i>Curiosity</i> to follow the scientists&#x2019; interests, which might take it across the slopes and boulders and surfaces that are endemic to Mars. And the air bags we&#x2019;d used like industrial-strength Bubble Wrap to drop smaller payloads onto the surface on more recent missions, like <i>Mars</i> <i>Pathfinder</i> and Mars Exploration Rover, would only rip, deflate, and smash onto the ground under the weight of a spacecraft this massive.</p><p>The solution we came up with: the Sky Crane, an approach that resembled something Wile E. Coyote might rig up with ACME Company products. It certainly didn&#x2019;t inspire confidence on paper. On first hearing about it, Mike Griffin, then the top boss at NASA, memorably said, &#x201c;I think this is crazy.&#x201d; We convinced him that it might just be the right kind of crazy, but we knew we were taking a risk.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s how we needed it to work:</p><p>After the nearly nine-month journey of 352 million miles, our work has barely begun. First we have to convert the spacecraft from an interplanetary probe to an atmosphere-tolerating &#x201c;aircraft.&#x201d; We switch the lander&#x2019;s electrical power from solar to nuclear. The spacecraft must be aligned at the proper angle to withstand 15 g&#x2019;s in deceleration forces and temperatures of 3,800 degrees Fahrenheit when it smacks into the atmosphere of Mars. About 7 miles from the surface, friction with the atmosphere will have slowed the lander&#x2019;s speed from 13,000 miles per hour to roughly 1,000. That&#x2019;s when we pop the supersonic parachute. Twenty-four seconds later, we blow off the heat shield so the radar can see. A mile above the surface, we let go of our parachute and light our rockets to navigate to an altitude of 60 feet. Then&#x2014;and here&#x2019;s the good part&#x2014;comes the Sky Crane maneuver, in which the <i>Curiosity</i> rover is lowered out of its &#x201c;rocket backpack&#x201d; by a set of cables. The two objects, rover and backpack, separated by 25 feet of cable, then descend to the surface. We have to retract the cables right after touchdown, in real time, so they&#x2019;ll stay taut as the rocket backpack continues to descend at a little less than 2 miles an hour. At this point, small guillotines cut the cables, and our rocket backpack, its job complete, flies a safe distance away and crashes into the surface, leaving the rover all alone and (we hope) ready to roll.</p><p>If any part of this scheme goes wrong&#x2014;and all it takes is one failure from among tens of thousands of components to cause catastrophic loss&#x2014;we will all look like idiots, and I&#x2019;ll be at the head of the line.</p><p>So you can imagine that the entire EDL team was already pretty amped up and more than a little bit anxious well before we discovered the glitch.</p><p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½</p><p>It was Miguel San Martin who found it. In addition to helping me manage and lead the EDL team at a systems level, Mig served as chief engineer for Guidance, Navigation, and Control. About seventy-two hours ahead of entry, he discovered an error in our &#x201c;center of navigation,&#x201d; a set of parameters meant to represent the dynamic heart of the spacecraft. The center of navigation is the point from which we make all measurements of dynamic motion. Our onboard computers conduct hundreds of thousands of calculations to determine just how fast the spacecraft is going and in exactly which direction, and they&#x2019;re all based on that agreed-upon starting point.</p><p>At JPL we test all our software over a variety of platforms, called test beds. They vary in level of sophistication, the most complete being a copy of <i>Curiosity,</i> unglamorously called VSTB (vehicle system test bed), that lives in what we call the Mars Yard, a tennis court&#x2212;size area of Mars-like rocks and rubble on the JPL campus. But so many parts of the mission and different software developers and teams were constantly struggling for time on her that we made a couple of other versions, not quite as complete, named MSTB (mission system test bed) and FSTS (flight software test set). As we prepared for landing, we ran lots of tests in each of these venues. These test results had to be reconciled with one another and differences understood. As we cruised toward Mars, we also had the actual spacecraft, and we could look at measurements taken on the spacecraft and compare them with data generated within our test beds. They should have all lined up; they should have all matched. Some of them didn&#x2019;t. Mig noticed a tiny discrepancy in the measurements taken on the spacecraft from the value he expected. Which is not how it ought to be.</p><p>This difference was reflected in the spinning centripetal acceleration&#x2014;the acceleration that pulls you toward the outside of a merry-go-round. On the way to Mars our spacecraft spins like a top for stability. The measurements of that spinning acceleration were off by a tiny bit, around 150 micro-g&#x2019;s, or less than the 0.00015 of Earth&#x2019;s gravitational acceleration. It was the kind of discrepancy that another engineer might have blown off completely, but it nagged the hell out of Mig. In 1997 he&#x2019;d been in charge of navigation and control on <i>Mars Pathfinder,</i> the mission that revitalized JPL and launched a new era in Mars exploration. After the spacecraft had landed safely, Mig discovered a time-tagging error in the data coming in from the radar. The discrepancy had not been large enough to endanger the mission, but it had been too close for comfort, and fifteen years later it still bothered him.</p><p>Mig&#x2019;s worries had a way of becoming my worries.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re leading even one component of a mission like this, you find yourself outwardly defending the reasonableness of your actions while, inside, you&#x2019;re criticizing the shit out of everything that&#x2019;s going down in order to find the one thing that can kill you. Even though I&#x2019;d spent nine years of my life on this project, I&#x2019;d always had a hard time imagining that it could work. The team had spent too many hours trying to anticipate all the ways it would <i>not</i> work. My thoughts in the months leading up to the landing were something like this: We are going ahead with this, and I can&#x2019;t imagine that it&#x2019;s going to work, and yet I can&#x2019;t think of a reason that it won&#x2019;t work, and for all I know it will work, but I&#x2019;ve also seen it <i>not</i> work in other missions, and I know that we don&#x2019;t know everything about the spacecraft because we can&#x2019;t, because it is bigger than all of us.</p><p>When a space mission goes wrong, it is rarely the gut-wrenching disaster of <i>Challenger,</i> the shuttle that blew up on live television in 1986, killing all seven crew members on board. Everything we know about a mission&#x2019;s success or failure comes from radio signals sent from millions of miles away. If your telemetry goes dead, it might just be a temporary communication error. In the past we&#x2019;ve lost contact with a space vehicle and had it come back. But we&#x2019;ve also lost contact with space vehicles and never heard from them again, which is the most likely outcome if our craft goes silent during EDL. All we need to declare failure is a persistent lack of data confirming success.</p><p>Through most of the journey to Mars, the spacecraft&#x2019;s location is at best an estimate made by radio telescopes on Earth. As it draws closer to Mars, though, the planet&#x2019;s gravitational pull begins to remove uncertainty. We know where Mars is, we know the law of gravity, and this knowledge improves our understanding of where the spacecraft is, but only really toward the last minute (or the last few hours actually). If you&#x2019;ve found something that doesn&#x2019;t add up, you have one last chance to make a change. It was in this time frame, this last getting-down-to-the-wire time frame, but completely independent of the Mars approach process, that Miguel found the problem.</p><p>After doggedly digging into the discrepancy he found between the spacecraft measurements and predictions, he got down to the essence of the problem, which consisted of three numbers representing the three axes that located the center of navigation. It turned out that when our supplier, Honeywell, delivered the inertial measurement unit&#x2014;the heart of the guidance system&#x2014;a JPL guy made a mistake logging in those three numbers. Rocket science is a high-tech world, but it&#x2019;s run by people, and people make mistakes.</p><p>During our spacecraft&#x2019;s long flight, we had regularly scheduled meetings to discuss software parameters we might want to tweak as we approached Mars, including trajectory parameters. Dust storms on Mars are a nightmare, and at all times we have a roomful of people obsessing over atmospheric updates, not just for the landing site but for the entire planet, in case we need to fine-tune the flight path we come in on. These types of parameters we had planned on changing, and we had structured the software to make it easy and safe to do so.</p></p><h2>Hopi Pottery Symbols</h2><p>Alexander M. Stephen, a self-taught anthropologist and an associate of Indian trader Thomas Keam, lived among the Hopi during the late nineteenth century.

It is a place created by a voice that moves with unerring ease between the commonplace and the sublime. The poems are filled with "the weather of leavetaking," but they are also unexpectedly funny. The erasure of self and the depredations of time are seen as sources of sorrow, but also as grounds for celebration. This is one of the difficult truths these poems dramatize with stoicism and wit. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, <b>Blizzard of One</b> is an extraordinary book--the summation of the work of a lifetime by one of our very few true masters of the art of poetry.</p><p>Mark Strand's <i>Blizzard of One</i> features a collage of his own devising on the cover: an expanse of red and blue geometric planes, broken up by the appearance of an ice floe on the imaginary horizon. The image invites the viewer to fill up the surrounding emptiness. So too does the white space surrounding Strand's taut, spare, metaphysical verse. The quest for the single lyric's integrity and wholeness sets Strand apart from those poets for whom the provisional is everything. And this is an artist who never shies away from the absolute: indeed, he manages to make each poem in the book recapitulate the beginning and the end. <p> There is a terrible atmosphere of finality and doom to these poems. In two splendid villanelles, for example, Strand pays homage to De Chirico, and the tension of lines like these brings with it a strange shiver of pleasure: </p><blockquote> Boredom sets in first, and then despair.<br> One tries to brush it off. It only grows.<br> Something about the silence of the square.<br> <p> Something is wrong; something about the air,<br> Its color; about the light, the way it glows.<br> Boredom sets in first, and then despair.<br> </p></blockquote> Strand continues to acknowledge his debt to Wallace Stevens, while taking the impulse to a further level of abstraction: "Even now we seem to be waiting / For something whose appearance would be its vanishing." Yet he can also deal lightly and self-mockingly with serious concerns: "Now that the great dog I worshipped for years / Has become none other than myself, I can look within / And bark, and I can look at the mountains down the street / And bark at them as well...." No poet has been able to make more out of a minimalist aesthetic than Mark Strand. He strives for elegance and masterful brevity, and whether he's working his ominous or light-fingered register, his formalism is never precious, always an agent of necessity. <i>--Mark Rudman</i>Mark Strand is a former Poet Laureate of the United States. He has written eight earlier books of poems, which have brought him many honors and grants, including a MacArthur Fellowship.

What are you hungry for? Food? Love? Self-esteem? &nbsp;Peace? In this manual for "higher health," based on the latest findings in both mainstream and alternative medicine, Deepak Chopra creates a vision of weight loss based on a deeper awareness of why people overeat - because they are trying to find satisfaction and wind up using food as a substitute for real fulfillment. &nbsp;Repudiating the failed approaches of crash dieting and all forms of deprivation, Chopra's new book aims directly at the problem of finding fulfillment. &nbsp;When that problem is solved, he argues, normal eating falls into place automatically, and the entire system of mind and body achieves what it really desires.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s life story is complicated, and the best intentions go astray because people find it hard to change,&#x201d; writes Chopra. &#x201c;Bad habits, like bad memories, stick around stubbornly when we wish they&#x2019;d go away.

The story begins when recently widowed, 76-year-old Natalie Seebring announces her scandalous engagement to none other than the vineyard manager, Carl, whose social standing is, needless to say, several notches beneath the Seebrings'. Natalie's children, Susanne and Greg, are furious with their mother for marrying the help, and only six months after their father's death.<p> Besides her remarriage, Natalie is working on a family history project, one she hopes will explain all the love and loss she has endured before reaching happiness at long last. She recruits Olivia Jones to help with the project, and Olivia and her daughter Tess move out to the vineyard for the summer. Tension builds with the summer heat as the wedding approaches. To make matters worse, Carl's son Simon, the new vineyard manager, is coldly resentful of Olivia and Tess, who remind him of the wife and daughter he has lost. But amidst all this, Natalie Seebring's long-buried past is slowly revealed, and like a summer storm, the truth blows through the vineyard, leaving everything different in its wake.</p><p> Barbara Delinsky says she was influenced by Tom Brokaw's <i>The Greatest Generation</i> in writing <i>The Vineyard</i>, and Natalie Seebring is a fine tribute to the strong, silent Americans who made so many sacrifices during World War II. Keep a hankie close by when reading this one. Family tragedy, unlikely romance, and old wrongs finally made right will have you laughing and crying. <i>--Francine McBride</i></p><b>Barbara Delinsky</b> has published more than sixty-six novels since the 1980s, including, most recently, <i>Lake News, Coast Road, Three Wishes, A Woman's Place, For My Daughters,</i> and <i>More Than Friends.</i> Published in twenty-five languages worldwide, her books regularly appear on the bestseller lists of <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>Publishers Weekly.</i> Delinsky is a lifelong New Englander.

The narrative unfolds with shimmering clarity, and takes us from the harsh northern Irish coast in the 1840s to the quarantine stations at Grosse Isle and the barely hospitable land of the Canadian Shield; from the flourishing town of Port Hope to the flooded streets of Montreal; from Ottawa at the time of Confederation to a large-windowed house at the edge of a Great Lake during the present day. Graceful and moving, <b>Away</b> unites the personal and the political as it explores the most private, often darkest corners of our emotions where the things that root us to ourselves endure. Powerful, intricate, lyrical, <b>Away</b> is an unforgettable novel.</p><p>On the northern coast of Ireland, young Mary O Malley embraces a drowning sailor washed ashore by the tide. So begins her family saga. Fleeing the great famine, she migrates across the Atlantic, through quarantine sheds and over the inhospitable land of the Canadian Shield. Her descendants trek from Port Hope to Montreal, from Ottawa to a house on the shore of Lake Ontario. Now Esther O Malley Robertson, the last of the O Malley women, is on the move.Jane Urquhart is the bestselling author of five internationally acclaimed, award-winning novels.

M. Stirling&#x2019;s <i>The Sky People</i>, aliens terraformed Mars (and Venus) two hundred million years ago, seeding them with life-forms from Earth. Humans didn&#x2019;t suspect this until the twentieth century, but when the first probes landed on our sister worlds, and found life&#x2014;intelligent life, at that&#x2014;things changed with a vengeance. By the year 2000, America, Russia, and the other great powers of Earth are all contending for influence and power amid the newly-discovered inhabitants of our sister planets. <br>&nbsp;<br>Venus is a primitive world. But on Mars, early hominids evolved civilization earlier than their earthly cousins, driven by the needs of a harsh world growing still harsher as the initial terraforming runs down. Without coal, oil, or uranium, their technology was forced into different paths, and the genetic wizardry of the Crimson Dynasty united a world for more than twenty thousand years. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, in a new stand-alone adventure set in this world&#x2019;s 2000 AD, Jeremy Wainman is an archaeologist who has achieved a lifelong dream; to travel to Mars and explore the dead cities of the Deep Beyond, searching for the secrets of the Kings Beneath the Mountain and the fallen empire they ruled. <br>&nbsp;<br>Teyud Zha-Zhalt is the Martian mercenary the Terrans hire as guide and captain of the landship Intrepid Traveller. A secret links her to the deadly intrigues of Dvor il-Adazar, the City That Is A Mountain, where the last aging descendant of the Tollamune Emperors clings to the remnants of his power...and secrets that may trace their origin to the enigmatic Ancients, the Lords of Creation who reshaped the Solar System in the time of the dinosaurs. <br>&nbsp;<br>When these three meet, the foundations of reality will be shaken&#x2014;from the lost city of Rema-Dza to the courts of the Crimson Kings.<br></p><p><br><p>S.

The atmosphere is thinner than Earth&#x2019;s, and is apparently growing thinner still; though it remains easily breathable for Terran humanity at the lower levels, uplands tolerable for Martians require oxygen masks of the type used by mountaineers on Earth. More significant is the fact that Mars has a thick, rigid crust that prevents the plate tectonics characteristic of the other two worlds.<br>Average temperatures on Mars are roughly 10 degrees Celsius lower than those on Earth, due to the lower solar energy input. This effect is moderated by the higher percentage of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, a phenomenon puzzling to scientists because the planet lacks the plate tectonics needed to recirculate carbon compounds and, presumably, has less vulcanism. The year, twice the Terrestrial, and the greater eccentricity of the Martian orbit render seasonal contrasts greater than the Terran norm even at the equator.<br>Temperatures on Earth may have been in a similar range, however, at some periods of geologic time (see &#x201c;Snowball Earth&#x201d;). It is believed that the gradual thinning of the Martian atmosphere and hence its reduced ability to hold heat has been offset to some degree by the gradual increase in the Sun&#x2019;s energy output over time.<br>The proportions of land and water on Mars are almost a precise reversal of those on Earth. Mars has seas surrounded by land, rather than land surrounded by oceans, and so the total land area is not dissimilar to that of Earth. The bulk of the water area is concentrated in the Great Northern Sea in the northern polar zone, with a smaller equivalent in the Antarctic Sea. Smaller bodies of water are present in parts of the main equator-girdling land mass . . . &nbsp;Mars, City of Zar-tu-KanTau-il-Zhi (Tower of Truth)May 1, 2000 AD&nbsp;&#x201c;How can you work for the vaz-Terranan? They&#x2019;re rich and they have some curious and powerful tembst, but by the First Principle, they&#x2019;re ugly!&#x201d; Jelzhau said, considering the board.<br>He moved his Chief Coercive diagonally two squares and threatened her Despot.<br>The woman who called herself Teyud za-Zhalt sipped at her flask of essence through the glass straw, savoring the musky tartness of the liquid, and then moved her Flier Transport onto the same square.<br>The mild euphoric was doubly pleasurable since Jelzhau would be buying if she won the game, and he had never toppled her Despot in a bout of atanj yet, unless she lost deliberately.<br>I am glad to have found alternate employment, she thought, studying the board. He never grasped that I was occasionally throwing the game, either.<br>Guarding the life of someone you&#x2019;d rather see dead was a means of earning your water too heavily spiced with irony for inner peace. Besides that, he was a cheapskate. Occasionally his atanj play was good enough to be entertaining, but usually . . . <br>Ah, yes. Once again, excessive conservatism in his employment of the Coercives and Clandestines. He relies too much on his Blockade and Boycott pieces, as might be expected of a spice merchant.<br>If you didn&#x2019;t exercise your Coercives, you increased the odds of their defection.<br>&#x201c;You deal with the vaz-Terranan, too,&#x201d; she pointed out, as he threw the dice to determine whose piece would win the battle for the square. &#x201c;Extensively.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That is a series of expeditious meetings. You have to associate with the hideous things. Ah, randomness falls out in your favor.&#x201d;<br>The dice showed three threes; that gave the paratroops in her Flier Transport time to emerge and capture his Chief Coercive.<br>&#x201c;Oh, not necessarily so very hideous,&#x201d; she said, taking the dice. &#x201c;Some are grotesque&#x2014;like a squashed-down caricature of humanity&#x2014;but some are just stocky and perhaps a bit irregular of feature and extremely muscular. The ones I&#x2019;ve met are all rather clever, too, if naï¿½ve.&#x201d;<br>Jelzhau shuddered. &#x201c;And they ooze. They&#x2019;re positively slick with water and mucus most of the time. You can feel it on their breath. An extra three on whether my Chief Coercive will defect?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oozing would be unaesthetic,&#x201d; Teyud admitted. &#x201c;Three, agreed.&#x201d;<br>She threw; three ones, a low-probability result. In the game, that meant her paratroopers had bribed or threatened his Chief Coercive to turn against his Despot. She moved the pieces, now both hers, into another square.<br>&#x201c;Your Despot is now confronted,&#x201d; she said formally. &#x201c;He must restore Sh&#x2019;u Maz, or abdicate.&#x201d;<br>Jelzhau sighed and tipped over the tower-shaped piece. &#x201c;He abdicates; your Despot proves superior fitness to perpetuate his lineage and establish Sustained Harmony. And as for the vaz-Terranan, they have a distinct and unpleasant odor, as well.&#x201d;<br>Her nostrils flared in irony; Jelzhau was given to excessive use of odwa-scent, himself.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t detect any untoward odor most of the time. In essential respects, they resemble us. For example, they have their own internal disputes and differences.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They all seem much alike to me.&#x201d;<br>Privately she thought the spice-factor was being a little bigoted, even if there was some truth to the physical description. The travelers from the Wet World couldn&#x2019;t help their semblance, and the ones from Kennedy Base usually dressed in local garb, and tried to behave in seemly fashion. Which was more than you could say of some of her own race, such as that clutch of deep-chested highlander caravaneers who were singing&#x2014;they probably thought it was song&#x2014;over in one corner, and pawing at one of the De&#x2019;ming servitors.<br>If you couldn&#x2019;t integrate an essence without losing harmony, you shouldn&#x2019;t partake in public.<br>Mind you, the Blue-tinted Time Considered As A Regressing Series was that sort of canal-side dive. It had seen better days, but those had probably been when the Crimson Dynasty still ruled. Someone was neglecting the glow-globes set in the fluid-stone of the ceiling fifteen feet overhead; badly fed, they gave off less light than they should, and it had an unpleasant greenish cast that made the figures of scholars and warriors on the wall look decayed.<br>And there was a grease mark on the smooth pearl granite behind her head; the taverner claimed that it had been made by the famous unbound hair of Zowej-ar-Lakrid in the Conqueror&#x2019;s student days, fifteen hundred years ago, when he was conspiring to overthrow the city&#x2019;s despot while playing atanj in this very spot, and that it would be sacrilege to remove it. Some deep layer of it might indeed be that old.<br>For the rest, the stopping-place looked depressingly like a thousand others she&#x2019;d seen, from one end of the Real World to another: a circular room on the ground floor of a tower more than half abandoned. In the more-traveled places near the exits the hard green stones of the floor were worn into troughs that menaced the balance of the patrons. Deepest of all were the spots before the entrance to the spiral staircase in the center of the room.<br>The floor was set with circular tables of tkem wood that had been polished blackness once and were nicked and dark grey now.<br>Hers held a tiny fretted-copper brazier with a stick of cheap incense burning, and a bowl of tart dipping sauce for the small platter that had held raw rooz meat cut into strips. She took the last strip between a mannerly thumb and forefinger, touched it to the sauce and ate.<br>Too hot, she thought. Cheap narwak badly ground, or steeped too long.<br>The meat at least was decently fresh, pleasant, lightly marbled, deep red, richly salted, and slightly moist; the animal had not lost its flaps in vain.<br>Just then the clock over the entrance to the staircase opened its mouth, gave a sad, piercing cry and sang:&nbsp;<br>Hours like sandOn the shores of a bitter seaFlow on waves of time;Seven hours have passedSince last the SunRose in blind majesty;It shall yield heedless to nightIn ten more.One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . . seven.&nbsp;&nbsp;That meant the flier would be arriving soon. Teyud packed her board and set, folding them into a palm-sized rectangle and slipping it into its pouch at her belt as they rose; Jelzhau would have taken the lead if Teyud had not adopted a hipshot pose of astonished sorrow. He flushed darkly and made his bow excessive.<br>&#x201c;True, you are no longer in my employ, Most Refined of Breeding,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she replied tranquilly, neglecting to add an honorific.<br>I wonder what the Wet Worlders truly think of us she wondered idly, as they began to trot upward.<br>It was still hard to have a conversation with them beyond the obvious, and they were less than frank about some things. That was probably wise of them&#x2014;everyone loved flattery, and criticism was rarely popular&#x2014;but a pity nonetheless. They were the first new things to come into the Real World for a very long time.<br>Even as her father&#x2019;s lineage reckoned such things. And they had ruled this world for twice ten thousand years.<br>But they do so no longer; now they hide in ruins and brood, she reminded herself. Do not waste life span in reverie on things past, as your father did . . . does. For each being, the time from birth to death is as that of the universe itself. You are not in the Tollamune Emperor&#x2019;s court at Dvor Il-Adazar now . . . and if you were within sight of the Tower of Harmonic Unity, you would die slowly.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This trip is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen this many Martian faces uncovered,&#x201d; Jeremy Wainman said as the Zhoming Dael slowed on its approach to the tall slimness of the tower. &#x201c;Here on Zho&#x2019;da, that is, not in videos back Earthside.&#x201d;<br>Martians called their planet Zho&#x2019;da; that meant &#x201c;The Real World,&#x201d; or possibly &#x201c;The Only Significant Place.&#x201d; It was all a matter of perspective, he supposed.<br>&#x201c;It makes sense to muffle up outside on this planet,&#x201d; said Captain Sally Yamashita of the United States Aerospace Force Astronaut Corps. &#x201c;Dry, cold, windy, lots of acrid dust. Plus&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>The Martian airship had made several stops on its way from Kennedy Base, but those had been at caravanserais and isolated trading posts. He and his superior were the only Earthlings&#x2014;vaz-Terranan in demotic Martian&#x2014;in the curved forward lounge with its transparent outward-sloping wall. The dozen or so locals mostly remained seated in their nests of cushions and traveling silks and furs, many with a board between them and the eternal Martian atanj game under way; it was routine for them. Jeremy leaned eagerly over the railing, looking as the long bright line of the canal opened out into the glittering shapes of the half-ruined city ahead.<br>&#x201c;Plus, it&#x2019;s the custom,&#x201d; he said, grinning and quoting the most common phrase in the orientation lectures that had started back on Earth right after the summons he&#x2019;d dreamed of but not seriously expected, and had continued at short intervals while the Brackett made its long passage out and then at Kennedy Base too.<br>&#x201c;I am an anthropologist, you know,&#x201d; Jeremy added. &#x201c;With a secondary degree in archaeology, to boot, and one in Martian history.&#x201d;<br>Sally nodded. She was tall by Terran standards&#x2014;everyone assigned to Mars was, though like her, most were below the Martian average. But even at five-eleven, she gave an impression of close-coupled energy, and her slanted hazel eyes were very keen. Her father had been California-Japanese, richer than God and a marine biologist with a hobby in martial arts; her mother was from a long line of Napa Valley winemakers but had broken the mold by going into modern dance. Sally&#x2019;s own specialty was the study of Martian technology; she had degrees in molecular biology and paleontology. But she was also a general fixer and contact person, helping Kennedy Base interface with the Martians. And, at thirty, she was several years older than Jeremy, with the weathered skin of an Old Mars Hand.<br>And . . . I think she&#x2019;s a spook. Not all the time, we&#x2019;re all multitasking here, but I think that&#x2019;s what she is if you dig down through all the layers. Why are they sending a spook on an archaeological scouting mission? Granted, this can be a very hairy planet, and she looks like she can clip hair with the best of them, but . . . <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an anthropologist . . . a very inexperienced anthropologist,&#x201d; she said.<br>It was his first trip outside Kennedy Base. He&#x2019;d seen pictures of the these towers with their time-faded colors and the lacy crystalline bridges that joined them, the transparent domes below full of an astonishing flowering lushness, the narrow serpentine streets between blank-faced buildings of rose-red stone . . . but now he could see them for himself. They reminded him a little of Indian Mughal architecture done by someone on opium and freed from the limits of stone and the constraints of gravity, but there was a soft-edged quality to them unlike anything his world had ever bred, as if they had grown here.<br>In the distance loomed jagged heights that had been the edge of a continent when the site of this city was below the waves of a vanished sea . . . <br>Sally snorted; he had a sudden uncomfortable feeling she knew just what sort of greenhorn romantic twaddle he was thinking. Her words confirmed it.<br>&#x201c;Even the experienced are just scratching the surface here. Venus may be full of hunter-gatherers or Bronze Age types like the Kartahownians, but this isn&#x2019;t Venus&#x2014;the Martians were doing calligraphy and building cities forty thousand years ago. The Crimson Dynasty ruled before the Cro-Magnons painted mammoths on those caves in France, and it fell about the time we invented writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We came to them, not vice versa,&#x201d; Jeremy pointed out. And I&#x2019;m teasing you. Do you have to be so solemn about everything?<br>Apparently she did. Even her nod was grave as she went on.<br>&#x201c;We have a technological edge. Sort of, or so we like to think. But Earth&#x2019;s a long way away and there aren&#x2019;t many of us here. We can&#x2019;t push these people around and we don&#x2019;t impress them much, either. I repeat: This isn&#x2019;t Venus. We can&#x2019;t play Gods-from-the-sky here. We&#x2019;re on sufferance. And never forget we don&#x2019;t know dick about this place, really.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, teacher,&#x201d; he said good-humoredly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to make us a little less abysmally ignorant, hmm? We do need to start learning more about Martian history.

So begins Sigrid Nunez's haunting novel about the poignant and unusual friendship between a writer and a retired army nurse who seeks her out decades after their childhood in the same housing project. Among the letters the narrator receives is one from a Rouenna Zycinski, recalling their old connection and asking if they can meet.Though fascinated by the stories Rouenna tells about her life as a combat nurse in Vietnam, the narrator flatly declines her request that they collaborate on a memoir. It is only later, in the aftermath of Rouenna's shocking death, that the narrator is drawn to write about her friend--and her friend's war. Writing Rouenna's story becomes all-consuming, at once a necessity and the only consolation.<br><br><i>For Rouenna</i>, an unforgettable novel about truth, memory, and unexpected heroism by one of the most gifted writers of her generation, is also a remarkable and surprising new look at war.<br></p><p><b>Sigrid Nunez</b> is the author of <i>A Feather on the Breath of God, Naked Sleeper</i>, and <i>Mitz</i>: <i>The Marmoset of Bloomsbury</i>.

Copyright ï¿½ 2001 by Sigrid Nunez. To be published in November, 2001 by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, LLC. All rights reserved.<br>After my first book was published, I received some letters. Most of them were from strangers, people who had read the book and who wanted me to know what they thought of it. They were friendly letters for the most part, though a few were critical. ("I hope you won't mind my saying that I did not like the ending at all," and so on.) I also heard from people I had known in the past. Near strangers: people I had not been in touch with for twenty, thirty years and whom I rarely if ever still thought about. Almost every one of these letters began with an expression of doubt that I would remember the sender, and my letters in reply always began with an assurance that I did remember, which was the truth. Even before I opened one of these letters, I would recognize the name written above the return address on the envelope. (Sometimes I recognized the handwriting.) Almost always unfamiliar, though, was the return address itself. These old acquaintances of mine, these ghosts from my past, had moved away from the places where I had known them, some very far. One of the few letters from the state of New York had been mailed from a men's penitentiary. Sometimes the writer wrote PERSONAL On the envelope, or PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL. "I hope you will remember my sorry ass," the letter from the inmate began, "now that it has landed in jail." <br><br>Unlike the ones I received from strangers, these letters were not usually about my book. In fact, often the writer had not read the book but had only heard of it, from a review, say, and had been moved to get in touch "after all these years." These letters tended to be long--three or four pages--and filled with autobiographical detail. They took me back--to college, to high school, and even further. I heard from three women who had been my best friends in seventh grade. (Most of the people I heard from were women.) Rarely was I surprised to learn what had become of people. They had married. They had had children. The jobs they were in were the jobs I might have predicted for them. It was their wanting to tell me all this that surprised me and that I found poignant. <br><br>I answered every letter. And usually that was the end of it. I would not hear from the person again, or if I did it was just once more. A much shorter letter might come; a postcard. One of s20the friends from seventh grade dug up and sent an old photograph, me at thirteen, along with a copy of a poem in my own juvenile hand, which I threw away, unread, remembering only too well the kind of poem I wrote at thirteen. <br><br>Time passed. A year, another year, enough time for me to finish another book--a long period when no such letters came. And then one day there came one more. ("I don't know if you remember me.") From Brooklyn this time. And this time I did not remember. <br><br>I did not remember a Rouenna Zycinski. I was sure I had never known her. But many years ago, according to her letter, we had been neighbors in the same public housing project, on Staten Island. She was older than I, this woman, the same age as my elder sister, and she remembered her, and my other sister, and my mother and father. She gave everyone's name and the number of the building we had lived in and the apartment number--she gave all this information in her letter, and it was all accurate. That world--the world of the projects--I had written about in my first book, which she had just read. The book had brought that world back to her, had brought back many memories, and that was all she wanted to say. <br><br>I answered the letter right away, thanking her for writing, and then I forgot about her, until a few weeks later, she wrote again. We were, she said (hardly accurately this time, in my opinion), neighbors once more. Brooklyn, Manhattan. Two stops on the L train. A matter of minutes. Could we meet? <br><br>I did not want to. I had no desire to meet this woman. She was a stranger, and I am wary of strangers. Ours was only the slenderest connection. Not even her name rang a bell. She and her family had moved out of the projects some forty years ago. My own family had moved out ten years later. Why should we meet? I could think of no good reason. And I had the uneasy feeling that this woman wanted something--something more than just to meet. I could not say what it was, but I sensed that there might be some danger--no, danger is melodramatic--some trouble that could come of meeting her, and I had enough trouble. Had she been a man, I do not think it would have been hard for me to say no. But a peculiar sense of obligation nagged me, as if I owed this woman, this perfect stranger from the margins of my book of memories--but what could I possibly owe her? <br><br>I had enough trouble. The arrival of this woman's letters coincided with an odd time in my life--an unhappy time. When her first letter came, I had just broken up with a man I had been living with for several years. I had moved out of the apartment we'd shared (his apartment before we met) and into a new one. I was alone. (She was alone, too; though she did not say so, I could not imagine Rouenna Zycinski except living all alone, those two subway stops away in Brooklyn.) Midway through unpacking, I had lost heart and quit. I was living in disarray, half out of boxes--I hardly knew where anything was. The kitchen was bare, I had not yet once used the stove--I went out for everything, from morning coffee to midnight drink. I went out alone--I was avoiding people. I was avoiding having to explain that G. and I were no longer together. I was avoiding having to answer questions about my work, about how my next book was going, and having to explain that it was not going, I had abandoned that book. I had not written anything for months. I'd had to move quickly and was forced to take more or less the first place I saw. Two small rooms that even put together would not have made one large one. The sofa here, the bed there, and no more space. The floor was splintery, the light was--well, there was no light. Almost all the tenants in the building were women. The landlord would not rent to single men or to families (not that it was easy to imagine any family squeezing into one of the cramped apartments that had been carved out of that once-elegant townhouse). So we were mostly women; I had young women living on all sides. I had forgotten how much young women cry. And it seemed I was not the only one with romantic troubles. I often heard couples fighting--how my pulse would surge whenever I heard that. And once, an anguished male voice bellowed up and down the air shaft--I love you, you bitch!--and I burst into tears. <br><br>In that building also were many cats. I think every woman had one. (Dogs were not allowed--the landlord had the same low opinion of dogs as he had of single men.) Coming home sometimes I would glance up at the facade of the building and see the familiar curvaceous silhouette in almost every other window. My own cat prowled the cluttered rooms with wide, disbelieving eyes. At first he meowed a lot, as if imploring me . . . Then he grew silent and grave, as (I supposed) the truth sank in: the order that he was accustomed to and needed and loved did not follow wherever we went but belonged to that other life, the one we had left behind forever. <br><br>Instead of making order, instead of settling down in my new place and getting on with life, I dreamed of going away. I had read Marguerite Yourcenar's account of how she had traveled by train across the United States, writing portions of her masterpiece, Memoirs of Hadrian. "Closed inside my compartment as if in a cubicle of some Egyptian tomb, I worked late into the night between New York and Chicago; then all the next day, in the restaurant of a Chicago station . . . then again until dawn, alone in the observation car of a Sante Fï¿½ limited." Page after page of this work that had given her so much difficulty for so many years now poured out of her, and: "I can hardly recall a day spent with more ardor, or more lucid nights." <br><br>Irresistible fantasy. New York to California. I would visit S. in San Francisco. Days of ardor. Lucid nights. Writing as I had never done before. <br><br>Irresistible fantasy: the look on G.'s face when I told him. It had been one of his chief complaints: I was incapable of just the sort of act I was now contemplating. I had no sense of adventure, I was the least spontaneous person alive. ("Someone says to you let's have sex, and you say just a minute I have to go make out my will.") If I did not do more--go out, travel, see more of the world, get more experience of life--I would end up having nothing to write about. It had been one of the last things he had said to me before we broke up (though he was hardly saying it to me for the first time), and the way he said it, that final time, I felt as if he were putting a curse on me. <br><br>It was not the sort of trip that people made anymore--certainly not alone. I was told that my fellow passengers would be mostly families. And things were different now than they had been in the forties. Now there would be music, or Muzak, playing in that Chicago station restaurant. Nor would Yourcenar likely find herself alone in that observation car. The trains were almost always crowded now, rarely quiet, hardly the place for reading, let alone writing masterpieces. Always the sound of someone's chatter or snoring, the tinny music coming out of other people's Walkmans, or the beeps and quacks of someone's computer game--this, at least, had been my own experience riding trains in recent years. The filth of the toilets. The bad food. The families with young children in neighboring compartments. "Will all the compartments be full?" I asked the booking agent. "Oh, yes. And you'd better make up your mind fast. We book these trains ten months in advance." <br><br>So much for spontaneity. <br><br>But I had fallen into one of those writer's traps: I had let myself become convinced that in order to begin writ...</p><h2>Why I Believe: Straight Answers to Honest Questions about God, the Bible, and Christianity</h2><p>In our post-Christian, pluralistic society, responding to the perception that Christians are prejudiced, anti-intellectual, and bigoted has become a greater challenge than ever before.

With the dragon suddenly under his daily care, the boy discovers that Star can speak in ways that only he can understand.&nbsp; Star reveals to him dragon lore long forgotten to the world, and offers to train the boy in the ways of the warrior. &nbsp;Straw discovers that although an orphan, he descends from a long line of dragon keepers and has taken his rightful place caring for Star, although this is something he can neither prove nor ever tell the others. &nbsp;In this way, the boy enters into a secret apprenticeship under the careful guidance of the dragon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years pass and, unknown to the rest, Straw is trained in the ways of a knight.&nbsp; Then one day, an army descends on the Dragon Compound, demanding a battle to the death between Star and their warrior king.&nbsp; A disaster would ensue were the otherwise gentle Star to be goaded to engage in battle.&nbsp; This would result in his abandoning the kingdom.&nbsp; When the knights of the realm fail in a tournament to curb the intentions of the warrior king, the dragon turns to Straw as his guardian to defend him.&nbsp; Straw, too young and inexperienced to openly challenge the king, meets him in the stables and provokes him into a fight in which the boy thrashes the far more experienced warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after this, Straw&#x2019;s training with Star is accidentally discovered.&nbsp; He is accused of inciting to battle the otherwise peaceful dragon, a state which the peace of the kingdom depends.&nbsp; Disgraced, Straw is banished from the Dragon Compound and the kingdom.&nbsp; However, before leaving, Straw receives all he needs to become a wandering knight: a horse, a sword, armor, and a name.</p><p>Donald Samson grew up in the mega-urban environment of Los Angeles at a time when the smog was thick and the freeways were flinging their tentacles throughout the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;After expanding his horizons through study at UC Santa Barbara, he sought fresh air and adventure.&nbsp; He set off for a dozen years of travel, living as an expat first in Greece, then for a long stretch in Germany, and finally landing in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland.

In the opening scene, 4-year-old Ruth Cole walks in on her melancholy mother, Marion, who is <i>in flagrante</i> with 16-year-old Eddie, the driver for drunken Ted (Ruth's dad and Marion's estranged, womanizing husband).<p> Eddie spends the rest of his life obsessively writing novels like <i>Sixty Times</i>, his roman ï¿½ clef about his 60 seductions by Marion. Ted is a failed novelist who gets rich and famous writing creepy children's stories based on tales he tells Ruth (such as <i>The Mouse Crawling Between the Walls</i>). Marion abandons Ruth, Ted, and Eddie and becomes a successful pseudonymous novelist. And Ruth becomes the most richly celebrated writer of them all because of her early training by Ted, who not only told her stories, but also helped her craft narratives to explain their home's many photographs of her brothers, who died in a gory car wreck the year before she was born. Grief over the boys is why Ruth's mother does not dare to love her.</p><p> Ruth, Irving's first female main character, works brilliantly, first as an imaginative, almost Salingeresque child coming to terms with her bewildering family, then as a grownup striving to understand her mother's motives--or at least to track her down. Ted is a mordantly funny caricature, interestingly sinister and plausibly self-justifying when most inexcusable. Eddie is a lovable schlemiel, yet not too sentimentally drawn. And what set pieces Irving can write! The story of the boys' death is horrific and effective in dramatizing the character of Ted, who narrates it. Ted's attempted murder by a spurned lover is as hilarious as the VW-down-the-marble-stairway scene in <i>A Prayer for Owen Meany</i> (which has been adapted by Disney Studios), though not quite on a par with the celebrated "Pension Grillparzer" episode in <i>The World According to Garp</i> (reissued in a 20th anniversary edition by Modern Library). </p><p> Irving has the effrontery to get away with practically any scene that comes into his head--Ruth winds up an eyewitness to a hooker's murder in Amsterdam, a Dutch detective starts tracking her down (just as Ruth is hunting Marion), and the multiple plot strands all converge in a finale that neatly echoes the opening scene. It's all done with the outrageously coincidental yet minutely realistic brio of Charles Dickens, with a sad, self-conscious jokiness like that of Irving's mentor, Kurt Vonnegut. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>&#34;John Irving, it is abundantly clear, is a true artist.&#34; --Los Angeles Times</p><h2>Azincourt</h2><p>Spine creased.

A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined. </p> <p> One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the "band of brothers" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption, <i>Agincourt</i> follows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#x2014;Bernard Cornwell at his best. </p> <p> <strong> Historical Notes on <i>Agincourt</i> by Bernard Cornwell</strong> </p> <p> </p><p>The battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Crï¿½cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.</p> <p>Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415 <i>la malheureuse journï¿½e</i> (the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journï¿½e with sadness. It had been a disaster.</p> <p>Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.</p> <p>The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.</p> <p><b>Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)</b></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>England and France, 1415:<br>One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>The French Coast:<br>The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.</td> <td>Harfleur:<br>Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.</td> <td>The Battle Lines:<br>&#x201c;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201d; &#x2013; William Shakespeare, <i>Henry V</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p></p>A brutal and visceral tour through the medieval world, where life is balanced on the point of an arrow, and where war is fought with every bit of sinew in one's body. . . .

Those stories are known by few today.</b></p>In <i>Our Lost Constitution, </i>Senator Mike Lee tells the dramatic, little-known stories behind six of the Constitution&#x2019;s most indispensible provisions. He shows their rise. He shows their fall. And he makes vividly clear how nearly every abuse of federal power today is rooted in neglect of this Lost Constitution. For example:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;The Origination Clause says that all bills to raise taxes must originate in the House of Representatives, but contempt for the clause ensured the passage of Obamacare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;The Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the NSA now collects our private data without a warrant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;The Legislative Powers Clause means that only Congress can pass laws, but unelected agencies now produce ninety-nine out of every one hundred pages of legal rules imposed on the American people.<br>Lee&#x2019;s cast of characters includes a former Ku Klux Klansman, who hijacked the Establishment Clause to strangle Catholic schools; the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who called the Second Amendment a fraud; and the revered president who began his first of four terms by threating to shatter the balance of power between Congress and the president, and who began his second term by vowing to do the same to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Fortunately, the Constitution has always had its defenders. Senator Lee tells the story of how Andrew Jackson, noted for his courage in duels and politics, stood firm against the unconstitutional expansion of federal powers. He brings to life Ben Franklin&#x2019;s genius for compromise at a deeply divided constitutional convention. And he tells how in 2008, a couple of unlikely challengers persuaded the Supreme Court to rediscover the Second Amendment&#x2019;s right to keep and bear arms.<br><br>Sections of the Constitution may have been forgotten, but it&#x2019;s not too late to bring them back&#x2014;if only we remember why we once demanded them and how we later lost them.

But like them, I wanted to give readers some glimpse into &#x201c;what it was like to be there.&#x201d; What was it like to live under King George&#x2019;s tyranny? What was it like for those who participated in the &#x201c;miracle in Philadelphia&#x201d; and produced our Constitution? If this book succeeds, it will help you feel as if you were right there at the pivotal moments of history, experiencing the rise and the fall of the constitutional provisions that I call the &#x201c;Lost Constitution.&#x201d;</p><p>To that end, I have taken some dramatic license on several occasions in telling these historical backstories. In no instance have I knowingly departed from what I have found in the historical record. But I have, for example, imagined what Alexander Hamilton might have said when he confronted a lynch mob at his college. And I have imagined some of what might have transpired behind closed doors at a dinner and special session of the Philadelphia Convention when Ben Franklin proposed the compromise that saved the Constitution.</p><p>At the outset of this project, I expected to use far more dramatic license than I have taken. In the course of my research, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the historical record is more dramatic than anything I could have imagined. It is also far more illuminating. As a result, with only a few exceptions, I found myself writing not historical fiction but history.</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>MY LOVE FOR THE U.S. CONSTITUTION TOOK ROOT IN MY EARLY years. From the time I was a young child, my parents taught me about the separation of powers, checks and balances, due process, equal protection, and the limited role of our federal government. It never really occurred to me that I was being taught about the Constitution; these were just conversations we had from time to time around the dinner table, in the car, and whenever the subject of government happened to arise. Before long, I learned what it meant to be an appellate lawyer because every time my siblings or I would disagree with our parents&#x2019; decisions about bedtimes or chores or allowances, they would say, &#x201c;Make your case. You&#x2019;re probably not going to win, but we&#x2019;ll listen.&#x201d;1</p><p>When I was about ten years old, I started routinely accompanying my dad whenever he argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. As kind and wise a man as I&#x2019;ve ever known, he was the founding dean of BYU&#x2019;s law school, and in 1981 he became the solicitor general of the United States, the federal government&#x2019;s chief advocate before the Supreme Court. I&#x2019;d watch with bated breath as the black-robed justices fired questions at him. He had a way of answering their questions in a manner that was not only responsive but also carefully calculated to advance his case. The verbal jousting I saw between lawyers and justices wasn&#x2019;t quite as raucous as the debates at our dinner table, but after the oral argument ended, my dad would be so excited that he reminded me of a giddy child on a sugar high.2</p><p>My dad didn&#x2019;t win every argument at the Supreme Court, but he did win most of them. More important, however, he had a near-perfect batting average at home. He could simplify even the most complicated of concepts, and I hung on his every word. I didn&#x2019;t always understand everything he said, but I sure made an effort&#x2014;especially because he had a way of making almost any subject seem interesting, and he loved it when any of his children showed genuine interest in the Constitution. I still remember how pleased he seemed when, as a fourth grader, I replied to his explanation of America&#x2019;s long-standing abortion debate by asking, &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t this issue be addressed by the states rather than by the federal courts?&#x201d;</p><p>My dad could hardly contain his joy. I was only nine or ten years old.</p><p>A year or two later, the same issue arrived at our front door&#x2014;literally. It was a cold morning in March. My parents had taken my three younger sisters shopping. My older brother was at a basketball game. The only people in the house were me and my older sister Wendy; and because she was still asleep, I was the only one who saw the most peculiar of vehicles pulling up in front of our house: a huge Greyhound bus.</p><p>Ours was a quiet suburban street in McLean, Virginia, many miles from the nearest bus stop. But even more unusual than the bus was the behavior of the dozens of people who poured out of it. I watched with wide-eyed curiosity as they began pacing the sidewalk in front of our house. They seemed to be chanting something, but exactly what I wasn&#x2019;t sure. Determined to figure out what was happening, I went outside, which made it easier for me to see and hear what they were saying. Their chant was simple and consistent with the words written on the signs they were carrying: &#x201c;Keep your laws off our bodies!&#x201d;</p><p>Immediately, mischievous thoughts flowed through my eleven-year-old mind. <i>Should I turn on the sprinklers? </i>I wondered. <i>Should I deploy my secret stash of firecrackers?</i> Like the boy in <i>Home Alone</i>,<i> </i>I instinctively felt the need to defend my parents&#x2019; home, and startling these protesters sounded like an awfully fun way to do it.</p><p>Fortunately, I was (barely) mature enough to resist my first instincts. <i>If I do that, it&#x2019;ll be on the news</i>, I thought. <i>That will end up causing problems for my dad, and I don&#x2019;t want to do that</i>.</p><p>Instead, I decided to calmly approach and speak to the strangers who had arrived without invitation or warning on our sidewalk. I found the woman who appeared to be in charge and said, &#x201c;I live in this house. Can you tell me why you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, little boy,&#x201d; she said in the most condescending way imaginable, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re not here to hurt you. We just really disagree with some of the things that your daddy is doing in his job.&#x201d;</p><p>It can be a little jarring when the first thing people tell you is that they don&#x2019;t mean you any harm. That&#x2019;s sometimes the first indication that the opposite is true.</p><p>In this case, I knew enough about my dad&#x2019;s job and the abortion debate to realize they were angry about arguments he had presented to the Supreme Court. I later learned that the case was <i>City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health</i>, a case involving the constitutionality of a city ordinance requiring second- and third-trimester abortions to be performed in hospitals and requiring minors to obtain either parental or judicial consent before obtaining an abortion. Appearing on behalf of the U.S. government (as <i>amicus curiae </i>or &#x201c;friend of the court&#x201d;), my father argued that, in adjudicating such constitutional questions, the Supreme Court should give due deference to states and local legislative bodies, especially where fact-laden questions of public policy are concerned. But that still didn&#x2019;t explain why these people were in front of my house.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but why do you have to do it here? Why do you have to do it in my front yard?&#x201d; After all, their signs said, &#x201c;Keep your laws off our bodies.&#x201d; Was it too much to ask them to keep their bodies off our lawn?</p><p>Apparently it was. She told me, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re being very careful not to step on your grass. I&#x2019;m sure that you have lots of fun playing with your friends out here. We&#x2019;re just staying on the sidewalk.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Boy</i>, I thought to myself, <i>she is really missing my point</i>. I wasn&#x2019;t concerned about the grass. My concern went beyond the technical distinction between private property and public easements. I had meant to make a fairly obvious point: You can disagree with people, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you should go where they sleep and eat and raise children, attempting to subject them and their families to public shame, scorn, and humiliation.</p><p>After a while, a concerned neighbor found me and asked, &#x201c;Hey, are you okay? Are you scared?&#x201d;</p><p>But as soon as he saw the smile on my face, he knew I was just fine. I loved discussing important questions of public policy, and my usual sparring partners at the dinner table were a lot tougher to debate than the obtuse protester on my sidewalk. While I was a little startled, I was having the time of my life.</p><p>For the next two hours, men, women, and even a few children&#x2014;apparently oblivious to the irony, they had brought <i>children</i> to an abortion-rights protest&#x2014;marched up and down our sidewalk, always careful not to step on the grass. A news crew came and went. Neighbors gawked inquisitively from time to time, but the whole affair didn&#x2019;t seem to hold anyone&#x2019;s attention very long&#x2014;including that of the protesters themselves. The sign-wielding activists whose voices became so familiar to me that day eventually grew tired of waiting for their much-anticipated, face-to-face confrontation with my father, who was still running errands with my mom and my three younger sisters. With disappointment showing on their faces, they climbed back into their bus and called it a day.</p><p>Within seconds after they left, my parents pulled into the driveway. In a stroke of bad luck for the protesters&#x2014;who had traveled all the way from New York and New Jersey to criticize my father&#x2014;they had missed him by less than two minutes.</p><p>I was standing next to the basketball goal at the end of our driveway, chomping at the bit to tell my parents about all the excitement they&#x2019;d missed. But before I could get out a word, my dad beat me to the punch. &#x201c;There was a huge Greyhound bus going out of the neighborhood,&#x201d; he said with a baffled look on his face. &#x201c;Do you know anything about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;</p><p>Although I disagree with the message of those protesters and believe they should have found a more appropriate place to march than the private residence of a public official, I admire their passion. At least they cared about the Constitution and the essential role it plays in limiting the power of government. At least they were willing to view government action with a critical eye, refusing to ignore what they perceived as a constitutional overreach. I wish more Americans&#x2014;even those who read the Constitution differently than I do&#x2014;shared their passion for identifying and enforcing constitutional limits on the power of government.</p><p>I wrote this book for people who share my lifelong love of the Constitution and my growing frustration with legislators, judges, and presidents who ignore and distort it. In one sense, this is a book about heroes and villains&#x2014;those who inspired, crafted, and respected liberty&#x2019;s safeguards and those who have tried to tear those safeguards down. But in another sense, this is a book with a message: The &#x201c;Lost Constitution&#x201d; should be restored, and it can be, but only if we remember the people and the stories behind it.</p><p>My wish for you is that you share your time not with me but with them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Ducking and Dodging the Constitution</p><p>I KEEP TWO TOWERS OF DOCUMENTS IN MY SENATE OFFICE. THE first is only a few inches tall. A collection of all the legislation passed by Congress in 2013, it contains about eight hundred pages.</p><p>The second tower, which is <i>eleven feet tall</i>, is a collection of regulations proposed and adopted by federal agencies in 2013. It contains about <i>eighty thousand</i> pages.</p><p>These extraordinarily unequal towers illustrate a startling reality: The U.S. Congress no longer passes most of the federal laws, rules, and regulations that are imposed on the American people. While a mountain of those rules are decreed by an army of unelected federal bureaucrats, only about 1 percent of the rules we must live by are enacted by the most accountable branch of government&#x2014;Congress.</p><p>Using a classic duck-and-dodge strategy, Congress routinely enacts legislation that purports to solve a genuine problem but provides no specific solutions. Congress then delegates to executive-branch bureaucrats the power to make legally binding rules or &#x201c;regulations,&#x201d; which will themselves determine the law&#x2019;s real-world impact. It&#x2019;s a brilliant plan; Congress gets all the credit for the popular goal and none of the blame for the controversial particulars of regulation.</p><p>One prominent example of this kind of lawmaking can be found in the Clean Air Act. The act essentially declares that &#x201c;we shall have clean air&#x201d; and then outlines a broad vision for limiting air pollution from both mobile sources (like cars) and stationary sources (like factories). The act contains relatively few details as to how its laudable objectives will be achieved. Instead, it authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make and enforce legally binding regulations that, far more than the act itself, restrict air pollution.</p><p>This approach certainly has its advantages, and few would dispute that America&#x2019;s air quality has improved substantially since the Clean Air Act&#x2019;s passage and implementation. I&#x2019;m happy, as I assume all Americans are, that the Clean Air Act has improved our nation&#x2019;s air quality. There is, however, a major problem with this method of lawmaking: It insulates lawmakers from voter accountability and thereby undermines one of our Constitution&#x2019;s most important features. It insulates members of Congress by giving them plausible deniability; they can blame the executive agencies for anything the voters don&#x2019;t like. The bureaucrats at those agencies, in turn, become a unique and privileged class of lawmakers; they are insulated from voter accountability because they are <i>never</i> required to stand for election.</p><p>Thus, when the EPA adopts a new regulation carrying the force of law, those who find that law unnecessary, unreasonable, or even harmful are left with little recourse. Understandably, they might complain to those who have been elected to represent them in Congress. Members of Congress instinctively respond to such complaints by expressing empathy for those harmed by the law and frustration with the EPA and then adding something like &#x201c;Well, that regulation was put in place by the EPA. That is where you should take your complaint.&#x201d; Of course, the people at the EPA&#x2014;as hardworking, well educated, and well intentioned as they may be&#x2014;tend not to be terribly concerned about citizen complaints because they cannot be voted out of office.</p><p>It can be hard for most Americans&#x2014;that is, those who don&#x2019;t work in Congress or monitor its operations on a full-time basis&#x2014;to understand how far our government has drifted from the Constitution&#x2019;s vision and in many cases its actual stated provisions. Many Americans probably assume that our lawmakers understand our founding document an...</p></p><h2>American Medical Association Complete Medical Encyclopedia (American Medical Association (Ama) Complete Medical Encyclopedia)</h2><p>A definitive medical reference from the American Medical Association offers an alphabetical listing of thousands of medical terms, including common ailments, surgical procedures and tests, benefits and side effects of drugs and other therapies, nutrition, medical research and the future of medicine, mental health, and alternative and complementary treatments. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>A definitive medical reference from the American Medical Association offers an alphabetical listing of thousands of medical terms, including common ailments, surgical procedures and tests, benefits and side effects of drugs and other therapies, nutrition, medical research and the future of medicine, mental health, and alternative and complementaryThe <b>AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION</b> is the world's most respected and renowned authority in medicine.

The voice whispers, shouts, and sings to us that this experience of being in form, in space and time, knowing life and death, has meaning. The voice is that of inspiration, which is within each and every one of us. </p> <p>In this groundbreaking book, <strong>Dr. Wayne W. Dyer </strong>explains how we&#x2019;ve chosen to enter this world of particles and form. From our place of origin, in ways that we don&#x2019;t readily comprehend now, we knew what we were coming here to accomplish, and we participated in setting this life process in motion. So why not think this same way? Why put the responsibility or blame on any one or any thing that&#x2019;s not a part of us? On Earth we have the capacity of volition&#x2014;we can choose&#x2014;so let&#x2019;s assume that we had the same capacity when we resided in the spiritual realm. We chose our physical body, and we chose the parents we needed for the trip. It doesn&#x2019;t seem too great a stretch to move into the idea that we chose this life in concert with our Source. </p> <p>Each chapter in this book is filled with specifics for living an inspired life. From a very personal viewpoint, Wayne Dyer offers a blueprint through the world of spirit to inspiration, your ultimate calling.</p></p><p><p></p><p>Affectionately called the &#x201c;father of motivation&#x201d; by his fans,&nbsp;<b>Dr. Wayne W.

Inspiration, Dyer writes, is the opposite of motivation and goal-oriented thinking, the latter, "grabbing an idea and carrying it through to an acceptable conclusion." Inspiration, on the other hand, is when "an idea has taken hold of us from the invisible reality of Spirit." To Dyer, getting rid of ego in all its manifestations is the first step to connecting with the power of inspiration. In alternately wise and plodding prose, Dyer cites self-laudatory examples of his own personal generosity to strangers as well as various synchronicities that he takes to be expressions of the interconnectedness of all things and signs that he is spiritually on the right path. Yet many of the ideas here seem recycled; anyone who has watched <i>What the Bleep Do We Know?</i> will be familiar with them, and Dyer's name-dropping asides about his Maui writing retreat and successful lifestyle can be off-putting. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After an inadequate investigation, her husband, Dr. Sam Sheppard, was charged with the crime, and a chain of events was set in motion that has caused more speculation, more publicity, and more cultural myth than any other American murder.<br><br>James Neff is an award-winning investigative journalist who, over the past ten years, has assembled the most compete set of Sheppard records in existence, including DNA analyses and interviews with every living person central to the case. He has also gained unprecedented access to crime-scene evidence that shows conclusively that Sham Sheppard did not murder his wife&#x2013;and points to the man who did. Peeling away the layers of fiction surrounding the case, Neff uncovers the factual events and the key players in a story that until now has been shrouded in mystery. <b>The Wrong Man</b> is a landmark work, a gripping narrative, and indeed the final verdict on America&#x2019;s most famous unsolved murder</p><p>Before O.J. Simpson, Sam Sheppard was probably the most famous man acquitted for murder in the United States. Sheppard was a suburban Cleveland doctor accused of murdering his wife in 1954. The essentials of his case are well known. Sheppard said he was asleep on the couch when he heard his wife scream from the bedroom; he ran up the stairs and was knocked out by her attacker. Before long, Sheppard himself became the leading suspect--and most of the public came to consider him guilty. In <i>The Wrong Man</i>, reporter James Neff offers a detailed and well-told narrative that argues for Sheppard's innocence. Based on 10 years of research and interviews with many of the people whose lives touched the case, from family members to jurors to Sheppard's famous attorney F. Lee Bailey, Neff's account seems convincing. He even proposes a perpetrator, who, Neff says, offered something "close of a confession" during an interview shortly before his death in 1998. There may never be a "final verdict" in the saga of Sam Sheppard, but many readers will think this book effectively closes the case. <i>--John Miller</i>&#x201c;An exhaustive piece of detective work...[Neff&#x2019;s] determination gives his book a gripping zealousness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>&#x201c;The Wrong Man is one of the most brilliant works in the true-crime genre to come along for a decade.

In horrifying yet necessary detail, former federal investigator Leon Podles surveys the full extent of the damage, showing how victims were failed by bishops, laity, therapists, police, courts, press, and even popes. Examining the history behind today's headlines, Dr. Podles reveals how centuries-old theological errors encouraged blind submission to hierarchy, by making obedience to authority the highest virtue. He also shines a light on the new theological errors, popularized since Vatican II, that glorify every type of sexual expression--including pedophilia. <i>Sacrilege</i> will prove an essential resource for all those concerned with the history and future of Catholicism.</p></p><p><p><b>Leon J. Podles</b> worked for twenty years as a Federal investigator. He received a Catholic education, attended seminary for a time, and earned his Ph. D. from the University of Virginia.

He can no longer deny (even to himself), that he's in love with his neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith. Cynthia, after all, sees in him a man of warmth and daring--if only he'll meet her halfway. <p></p><p>But now a wealthy widow is pursuing Father Tim with hot casseroles. And the mysterious Cousin Meg has moved into the rectory bag and baggage--not to mention uninvited.</p><p> Abounding with characters both old and new, A Light in the Window compels readers to do something they treasure: laugh out loud.</p><p> Praise for the companion volume, <i>At Home in Mitford</i>: </p><b>Jan Karon</b> left a successful, award-winning career in advertising to move to Blowing Rock, North Carolina, a peaceful village not unlike Mitford. She says, "I write to give readers an extended family, and a little town they can call their own."</p><p><i>A Light in the Window</i> is the second installment in this enormously popular series about a small-town rector, Father Tim, and the heartwarming cast of characters surrounding him. This time Father Tim, a lifelong bachelor, finds his heart distracted by his free-spirited neighbor Cynthia, but his stomach and the rectory cash box are distracted by Edith, a wealthy widow who is wooing the rector with love potion casseroles. At every turn, including when a brooding Irish cousin decides to move in, Father Tim must decide whether he will practice what he preaches. <p> Fans of the series say they long to buy real estate in Mitford, just so they can live next door to these funny and endearing characters and feel the embrace of such a loving community. But what author Jan Karon probably knows, and many readers are starting to figure out, is that the integrity and solid Christian values that these characters possess can be found in just about every neighborhood, and with inspiration like this book, anyone can build their own Mitford community. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.</p> <p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p> <p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p> <p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago.

She proposes that these poems, usually read separately, are imperfectly seen unless seen together--that they form a sequence in which Keats pursued a strict and profound inquiry into questions of language, philosophy, and aesthetics. </p><p> Vendler describes a Keats far more intellectually intent on creating an aesthetic, and on investigating poetic means, than we have yet seen, a Keats inquiring into the proper objects of worship for man, the process of soul making, the female Muse, the function of aesthetic reverie, and the ontological nature of the work of art. We see him questioning the admissibility of ancient mythology in a post Enlightenment art, the hierarchy of the arts, the role of the passions in art, and the rival claims of abstraction and representation. In formal terms, he investigates in the odes the appropriateness of various lyric structures. And in debating the value to poetry of the languages of personification, mythology, philosophical discourse, and <i>trompe l'oeil</i> description, Keats more and more clearly distinguishes the social role of lyric from those of painting, philosophy, or myth. </p><p> Like Vendler's previous work on Yeats, Stevens, and Herbert, this finely conceived volume suggests that lyric poetry is best understood when many forms of inquirythematic, linguistic, historical, psychological, and structural-are brought to bear on it at once. </p></p><p>Helen Vendler widens her exploration of lyric poetry with a new assessment of the six great odes of John Keats and in the process gives us, implicitly, a reading of Keats&#39;s whole career.<b>Helen Vendler</b> is A.

The younger Price, through a dedicated search of clippings, letters, and her father's old journals, paints a beautifully rich portrait of a man with personal grace, intellectual fire, and a kind heart. Price reveals everything from odd little tidbits--Vincent was cast in his first London stage production due to his gum-chewing abilities--to profound depths, such as his lifelong love of art and his serious reputation as a student and collector. Price also had a surprisingly good sense of humor, indulging in genially self-deprecating jokes about his own occasionally abysmal movies. <p>Though this is definitely a loving memoir of her father, Victoria Price is not blinded by her affection for him. She gives an earnest attempt at presenting the whole man--fact-checking and debunking a few cherished family legends and unflinchingly reporting her father's youthful anti-Semitism. (As Price grew more worldly and met some actual Jews, he reversed his position and became an active supporter of B'nai Brith and the Jewish Anti-Defamation League.) But <i>A Daughter's Autobiography</i>'s may best value may be as a handbook for actors: through the numerous ups and downs of his career, Price remained a consummate professional. He never stopped working to improve his skills, deliberately sidestepping romantic-lead parts to take on more challenging roles, and was unfailingly generous to his costars. A truly engrossing look at the noble character of one of the silver screen's greatest villains. <i>--Ali Davis</i></p>Victoria Price is a television screenwriter, and is also at work on a study of Ranier Maria Rilke and his circle.

Kathy is getting married. It&#39;s the summer of 2017 and the whole world is falling apart. From a Tuscan hotel for the super-rich to a Brexit-paralysed UK, Kathy spends the first summer of her 40s trying to adjust to making a lifelong commitment just as Trump is tweeting the world into nuclear war. But it&#39;s not only Kathy who&#39;s changing. Political, social and natural landscapes are all in peril. Fascism is on the rise, truth is dead, the planet is hotting up. Is it really worth learning to love when the end of the world is nigh? And how do you make art, let alone a life, when one rogue tweet could end it all. Olivia Laing radically rewires the novel in a brilliant, funny and emphatically raw account of love in the apocalypse. A Goodbye to Berlin for the 21st century, Crudo charts in real time what it was like to live and love in the horrifying summer of 2017, from the perspective of a commitment-phobic peripatetic artist who may or may not be Kathy Acker . . .</p><p>OLIVIA LAING is a widely acclaimed writer and critic. She writes for the Guardian, New Statesman and Frieze among many other publications. Her first book, To the River, was shortlisted for the Ondaatje Prize and the Dolman Travel Book of the Year.

She lives in London.Crudo has all the beauty and music and clarity of Olivia Laing's non-fiction, but with something more too. Entrancing, charming, fascinating, I literally couldn't put it down. -- Jeremy Gavron Crudo has crept up on me. I have just finished it and I am filling up with tears and I am not sure why. It seemed to be speaking from deep within me and also at me, like a mirror that won't leave me alone, that insists I stare into it day after day, talking to me, to my gaze. What a special piece of work. And the rhythm is perfect. -- Lara Pawson Sharp, witty, compassionate and totally engaging. Crudo is a brilliant novel. -- Patrick McGrath It is an extraordinary novel of style and savagery: poised, transgressive and transformative. I read it hungrily. It left me licking my lips -- Jon Day Witty, hectic, effervescent, and deliciously derailing, Olivia Laing's first venture into fiction holds up a mirror to our troubled times -- Rupert Thomson Crudo feels like a perfect response to the nasty, lovely days that we're living in and the contemporary smorgasbord of identities . . . The presence of Kathy Acker was brilliantly handled - I believed so completely, for the duration of the novel, that she had lived through last summer. I love how Laing throws these lines to the past - it feels unique to her writing. And it's weirdly reassuring. -- Sara Baume Olivia Laing is a genius - not a word I throw about lightly. It is raw and breathless and effortlessly radical, and having turned the last page I couldn't even set it down before beginning it again. In a time of political auto-satire and the surreal unravelling of meaning itself, many novelists are left uncertain how they ought to respond. This - Crudo - is how. -- Francesca Segal I adored Crudo. I believe it is a great novel. Olivia writes so beautifully about life and nature in both city and country, and always finds some aspect to laugh about, one feels today's world is worth saving. I also adore Kathy, her whacky, sexy, promiscuous heroine. The story is so funny and touching, I can't wait to read it again. -- Jilly Cooper A dazzling, profound and darkly comic inquisition into what it is to be human. To read Crudo is to experience magic on every page. Olivia Laing's writing leaves me breathless with awe -- Elizabeth Day, author of <i>The Party</i> Chic, compassionate, crabby, perspicacious, and marvellously playful - Crudo is a huge-hearted novel that conveys the weight of the world with the lightest touch - I loved the mercurial energy that flew off its fast-turning pages. -- Claire-Louise Bennett, author of <i>Pond</i> We hereby acknowledge the irresistible rise of Olivia Laing, a writer incapable of anything other than full-on, nonstop brilliance. Crudo, her secular creed for crazy times, only proves her magical moment: to be there in it, and to take us along, too. One long electric dream, spinning with intimate energy and the sharpest saddest funniest humour, it's so utterly in-the-moment that you'll forget you aren't reading about yourself. -- Philip Hoare, author of <i>RISINGTIDEFALLINGSTAR</i> Reading Olivia Laing's short, sleek novel Crudo is like seeing the (very) recent past through a wall of mirrors. Laing adopts fragments of Kathy Acker's writings and life to arrive at a narrative style that's readable, shockingly new, and surprisingly tender. I didn't want it to stop. -- Chris Kraus, author of<i> I Love Dick</i> Written at a war-mongering time of rising nationalisms, the vitality of Olivia Laing's questioning love letter to life and to art will blow you away -- Deborah Levy Chic, compassionate, crabby, perspicacious, and marvellously playful - Crudo is a huge-hearted novel that conveys the weight of the world with the lightest touch - I loved the mercurial energy that flew off its fast-turning pages. -- Viv Albertine</p><h2>Secrets of the Zohar: Stories and Meditations to Awaken the Heart</h2><p>As the first person to translate the entire 23-volume Zohar from Aramaic into English, Michael Berg is uniquely qualified to convey its timeless wisdom to a wider audience. In these pages, he reveals its secrets as never before. Berg deciphers the encoded words of the ancient sages and explains and organizes them in a way that anyone can comprehend. He interprets&nbsp;the&nbsp;Zohar's&nbsp;most important stories, offering a special meditation for each one. Most importantly, he presents&nbsp;the wisdom from this great book&nbsp;in both Aramaic and English since, according to Kabbalah&#x2019;s greatest sages, The Light of the Creator is embodied in the Zohar&#x2019;s very letters and words, and scanning it in the original language is as important as reading the translation.

Having been born into a kabbalistic tradition as the son of the Rav and Karen Berg, Michael steeped himself in the wisdom of the Zohar at a young age, beginning its translation when he was only 18 years old and completing it ten years later.<p> Adept at combing through ancient materials and distilling complex information into elegant thought and language, Michael continues the tradition started by Rav Berg, of condensing and simplifying the profound wisdom of Kabbalah. As a best-selling author he has developed a worldwide following with more than eight books, such as Becoming Like God, Well of Life, The Secret, and national bestseller The Way. His recent projects include compiling, editing, and publishing Rav Ashlag s pillar works: The Wisdom of Truth, And You Shall Choose Life, On World Peace, The Thought of Creation, and The Light of Wisdom.

Dalï¿½ thought himself a genius with a right to indulge in whatever lunacy popped into his head.<br> <br> Painter, sculptor, writer and film maker, Salvador Dalï¿½ (1904 - 1989) was one of the century&#x2019;s greatest exhibitionists and eccentrics - and was rewarded with fierce controversy wherever he went. He was one of the first to apply the insights of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis to the art of painting. Dalï¿½ brought extraordinary sensitivity, imagination and concern for precision to bear upon submerged levels of consciousness.<br> <br> This lively biography presents the infamous Surrealist Dalï¿½ in full colour and in his own words.

Bored with living in the shimmering Void with his bickering Uncle Deva and Aunt Penelope, Mr. g creates time, space, and matter--then moves on to stars, planets, consciousness, and finally intelligent beings with moral dilemmas.<br><br> But even the best-laid plans can go awry, and Mr. g discovers that with his creation of space and time come unforeseen consequences--especially in the form of the mysterious Belhor, a clever and devious rival. An intellectual equal to Mr. g, Belhor delights in provocation: he demands an explanation for the inexplicable, requests that intelligent creatures not be subject to rational laws, and maintains the necessity of evil. As Mr. g watches his favorite universe grow into maturity, he begins to understand how the act of creation can change the Creator himself.</p><p>ALAN LIGHTMAN was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and educated at Princeton and the California Institute of Technology, where he received a PhD in theoretical physics.

As a matter of fact, time didn&#x2019;t exist. Nor space. When you looked out into the Void, you were really looking at nothing more than your own thought. And if you tried to picture wind or stars or water, you could not give form or texture to your notions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those things did not exist. Smooth, rough, waxy, sharp, prickly, brittle&#x2014;even qualities such as these lacked meaning. Practically everything slept in an infinite torpor of potentiality. I knew that I could make whatever I wanted. But that was the problem. Unlimited possibilities bring unlimited indecision. When I thought about this particular creation or that, uncertain about how each thing would turn out, I grew anxious and went back to sleep. But at a particular moment, I managed . . . if not exactly to sweep aside my doubts, at least to take a chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Almost immediately, it seemed, my aunt Penelope asked me why I would want to do such a thing. Wasn&#x2019;t I comfortable with the emptiness just as it was? Yes, yes, I said, of course, but . . . You could mess things up, said my aunt. Leave Him alone, said Uncle Deva. Uncle toddled over and stood beside me in his dear way. Please don&#x2019;t tell me what to do, retorted my aunt. Then she turned and stared hard at me. Her hair, uncombed and knotted as usual, drooped down to her bulky shoulders. Well? she said, and waited. I never liked it when Aunt Penelope glowered at me. I think I&#x2019;m going to do it, I finally said. It was the first decision I&#x2019;d made in eons of unmeasured existence, and it felt good to have decided something. Or rather, to have decided that something had to be done, that a change was in the offing. I had chosen to replace nothingness with something. Something is not nothing. Something could be anything. My imagination reeled. From now on, there would be a future, a present, and a past. A past of nothingness, and then a future of something.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, I had just created time. But unintentionally. It was just that my resolution to act, to make things, to put an end to the unceasing absence of happenings, required time. By deciding to create something, I had pressed an arrow into the shape- less and unending Void, an arrow that pointed in the direction of the future. Henceforth, there would be a before and an after, a continuing stream of successive events, a movement away from the past and towards the future&#x2014;in other words, a journey through time. Time necessarily came before light and dark, matter and energy, even space. Time was my first creation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes, the absence of a thing is not noticed until it is present. With the invention of time, events that had once merged together in one amorphous clot began to take shape. Each event could now be enveloped by a slipcover of time, separating it from all other events. Every motion or thought or the slightest happenstance could be ordered and placed exactly in time. For example, I realized that I had been sleeping for a very long time. And near me&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t say how near, because I had not yet created space&#x2014;Aunt Penelope and Uncle Deva had also been sleeping, their loud snores rising and falling like something or other, their tossings and turnings unfolding in time. And their interminable bickering could now be identified with moments of wakefulness, which in turn could be understood as taking place between periods of sleep. I refused to think how much time I had wasted. In fact, we had all slept in a kind of pleasant amnesia, a swoon, an infinite senselessness. In various ways, had we not luxuriated in the unstructured Void, unaccountable for our actions? Yes, unaccountable. Because without time, there could be no reactions to actions, no consequences. Without time, decisions need not be considered for their implications and effects. We had all been drifting in a comfortable Void without responsibilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>See, my aunt complained when it became apparent that we were now conscious of time. I told you that you would mess things up. She shot Uncle a look of disapproval, as if he had encouraged me to act as I had, and then she began an unhappy summary of the various things that she had done and not done during the immediate past, then during the past before that, and so on, back and back through the now visible chasms of time, until Uncle begged her to stop. You should never have created the past and the future, she said. We were happy here. See, now I must say <i>were</i>, when before . . . Oh! There it is again. It was nicer when everything happened at once. I can&#x2019;t stand to think about the future. But don&#x2019;t you think that we have some responsibility to the future? I suggested. To all the things and beings I might create? Non- sense, shrieked Aunt Penelope. What a foolish argument. You have no responsibility to things that don&#x2019;t yet exist and won&#x2019;t ever exist if you could just keep your big thoughts to yourself. But it&#x2019;s too late now, she went on.

Bennett returns with an inspiring collection of wisdom from the men and women who founded our great nation. On that hot July day in 1776 when our forefathers pledged "our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor" to establishing a free country, they started a revolution based on fundamental values such as patriotism, love, civility, education, industry, justice, and piety. The advice offered by the Founders on these values still rings true for young people today. </p><p> In speeches, letters, poems, and articles, the words and deeds of the brave men and women of the Revolution reveal the basic principles of how to be a good American. Witness the courage of George Washington crossing the Delaware. Enjoy the expression of true love between John and Abigail Adams. Feel the great bond of friendship between Madison and Jefferson. And take to heart the lessons on education and frugality of Benjamin Franklin. </p><p> Drawn from the best-selling adult book <i>Our Sacred Honor,</i> this adapted version includes new selections, plus important documents such as the Constitution and Declaration of Independence; a time line; and biographical notes on our revolutionary forefathers. <i>Our Country's Founders</i> provides all the background needed to appreciate these timeless lessons and advice from America's founders.</p></p><p><b>William J.

However, the introduction and editorial comments throughout are new and simplified for this audience, and additional materials such as the famous stories about Betsy Ross and Washington's cherry tree have been added. The chapter headings clearly denote the tenor of the advice: "Patriotism and Courage," "Love and Courtship," "Civility and Friendship," etc. Sources, credits, and attributions are scrupulously listed at the end of the book, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. While it is unlikely that many young people will choose this collection of historical writings for leisure reading, it is a valuable resource on the beliefs and ideas of Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and other leaders of that period. Letters between husbands and wives, most famously Abigail and John Adams, advice from parents to children, diary entries, speeches, printed materials, and epitaphs all attest to the humanity and personal attributes of these often over-sanctified figures. Their doubts and disputes, their genuine feelings of friendship and affection, and their profound belief in the ideals of democratic government are expressed in their many writings.

We do not know.</p><p>&#x2014; Benjamin Harrow, The Vitamines: Essential Food Factors, 1922</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first time I saw a vitamin in pure form&#x2014;as opposed to just gulping one down in a pill&#x2014;was in Parsippany, New Jersey. It was a drizzly November day, and I was visiting the Nutrition Innovation Center, a product-?development facility run by the world&#x2019;s largest synthetic vitamin producer, the Dutch company DSM.</p><p>Companies come to the center to brainstorm and create new products, harnessing the expertise of DSM&#x2019;s chemists and flavor technicians to add vitamins and other so-called functional ingredients to their foods. But I hadn&#x2019;t come to develop a new fortified beverage or cereal or snack bar. My goal was more basic: after more than three decades of eating and taking vitamins, I had come to the center to learn what vitamins actually are.</p><p>My host for the day was DSM&#x2019;s senior director of global technical marketing, a French-?born pharmacist and PhD named Jean-?Claude Tritsch, who had ear-?length graying hair and wore a pink V-neck sweater. We were in the room where product concepts are shared and sampled with food and supplement companies, and Tritsch was explaining the basics of vitamins from behind a wet bar as I sat perched on a high stool at a granite countertop, a selection of product prototypes arranged in front of me.</p><p>When we hear the word &#x201c;vitamin,&#x201d; many of us immediately think of pills; we also tend to mistakenly apply the term to all dietary supplements, and often lump vitamins and minerals together. But as Tritsch explained, there are actually only thirteen human vitamins, all of which are organic compounds that occur naturally in food. Four are fat-?soluble, meaning they dissolve in fat and need fat to be absorbed: A (retinol), D (cholecalciferol), E (tocopherol), and K (phylloquinone). The other nine are water-?soluble: C (ascorbic acid) and the eight substances grouped together in what&#x2019;s called the B complex&#x2014; B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin, also sometimes referred to as vitamin H), B9 (folate/folic acid), and B12 (cobalamin). Sometimes choline is counted as a fourteenth vitamin, but usually the roster ends at thirteen. (Some vitamins come in more than one chemical form&#x2014; the parentheticals refer to the most common or the most relevant.)</p><p>Unlike the macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrate), vitamins are not burned as fuel; instead, their primary role is to facilitate chemical reactions in our bodies that keep us alive. Vitamins, Tritsch told me, are thus considered essential micronutrients&#x2014; essential because our bodies require them but can&#x2019;t make sufficient quantities, which means we need to get them from outside sources, and micro because we only need them in really small amounts, typically fewer than 100 milligrams a day.</p><p>Indeed, we need vitamins in amounts so tiny that it&#x2019;s difficult to visualize them, let alone to believe that our lives depend on them. The amount of folic acid that pregnant women are told to take to prevent devastating neurological defects in their babies is 240 micrograms a day, less than the weight of two grains of Morton salt. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D, without which you won&#x2019;t be able to properly absorb calcium and your bones will soften, is 15 micrograms (600 IU), one-?sixteenth of that for folic acid. And the RDA for B12, a vitamin whose deficiency can cause depression, delusions, memory loss, incontinence, nerve damage, and in extreme cases life-?threatening anemia, is smaller still, just 2.4 micrograms&#x2014;0.0000024 grams. That&#x2019;s 1/ 100th of the weight of the requirement for folic acid, the equivalent of 1/ 67th of one grain of salt.</p><p>Searching for a way to make those tiny numbers tangible, Tritsch let me taste and smell several samples of pure vitamins that were kept on hand at the lab. Vitamin C was a talc-?like white powder, tart like a Super Lemon candy and very irritating, I discovered with the help of a paper cut, if rubbed into an open wound. Thiamin was bitter and white. Powdered riboflavin was the color of butternut squash. Folic acid was yellow and tasted chalky. A and D were clear, sticky, meltable crystals, so concentrated and unstable that they&#x2019;re usually dissolved in oil. E was a tasteless, viscous clear fluid. Vitamin B12 was bright pink.</p><p>By the time I left the Innovation Center, I&#x2019;d seen diagrams of vitamins&#x2019; chemical structures and magnified photographs of individual molecules, colorful crystals that sparkled in the light. But even after I&#x2019;d touched them, tasted them, and smelled them, I still couldn&#x2019;t wrap my head around what I was experiencing. It seemed somehow impossible that these odorless, unassuming substances could be essential for keeping me&#x2014;and every one of us&#x2014;alive.</p><p>The problem, I realized, was that I still didn&#x2019;t understand what vitamins do in our bodies&#x2014;which is a necessary concept to grasp if you want to understand why a deficiency could kill you. So I decided to look for an explanation in the vitamin I thought I knew the best: vitamin C.</p><p>Most people know that if you don&#x2019;t have enough vitamin C, you&#x2019;ll develop a vitamin deficiency disease called scurvy, and you have probably heard tales of sailors on long sea voyages whose teeth fell out as a result. But having loose teeth, while certainly unpleasant, doesn&#x2019;t sound life-threatening. And besides, scurvy can be cured by drinking orange juice. How serious could it really be?</p><p>Really serious, it turns out. Far from just affecting their gums, scurvy killed more than two million sailors between Columbus&#x2019;s 1492 transatlantic voyage and the rise of steam engines in the mid-?nineteenth century. It was such a problem that ship owners and governments counted on a 50 percent death rate from scurvy for their sailors on any major voyage; according to historian Stephen Bown, scurvy was responsible for more deaths at sea than storms, shipwrecks, combat, and all other diseases combined.</p><p>Scurvy starts with lethargy so intense that people once believed laziness was a cause, rather than a symptom, of the disease. Your body feels weak. Your joints ache. Your arms and legs swell, and your skin bruises at the slightest touch. As the disease progresses, your gums become spongy and your breath fetid; your teeth loosen and internal hemorrhaging makes splotches on your skin. Old wounds open; mucous membranes bleed. Left untreated, you will die, likely as the result of a sudden hemorrhage near your heart or brain.</p><p>Bown quotes a survival story written by an unknown surgeon on a sixteenth-?century English voyage that illustrates scurvy&#x2019;s horror. &#x201c;It rotted all my gums, which gave out a black and putrid blood,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;My thighs and lower legs were black and gangrenous, and I was forced to use my knife each day to cut into the flesh in order to release this black and foul blood. I also used my knife on my gums, which were livid and growing over my teeth. . . . When I had cut away this dead flesh and caused much black blood to flow, I rinsed my mouth and teeth with my urine, rubbing them very hard. . . . And the unfortunate thing was that I could not eat, desiring more to swallow than to chew. . . . Many of our people died of it every day, and we saw bodies thrown into the sea constantly, three or four at a time.&#x201d;</p><p>Scurvy affected many of the explorers we learned about in grade school&#x2014;Vasco da Gama lost his brother to it; Ferdinand Magellan watched it kill many of his men, who had been reduced, he wrote, to existing on &#x201c;old biscuit reduced to powder, and full of grubs, and stinking from the dirt which the rats had made on it when eating the good biscuit.&#x201d; Scurvy killed so many men on the 1740&#x2013;1744 voyage commanded by a British captain named George Anson that it is considered one of history&#x2019;s worst medical disasters at sea.</p><p>When reading about such experiences, it&#x2019;s difficult not to want to travel back in time, grab these men by the shoulders, and beg them to eat some lemons. The idea that certain foods can cure scurvy wouldn&#x2019;t even have been a new idea&#x2014;in 1535, French explorer Jacques Cartier reported that after his ships had become frozen in the St. Lawrence River, his men were saved from scurvy by a special tea, prepared by the local Native Americans from the bark and leaves of a particular tree. In the 1500s and 1600s, several ships&#x2019; captains suggested that there might be a connection between produce and scurvy. In 1734, a Dutch physician named Johannes Bachstrom came up with the term &#x201c;antiscorbutic&#x201d;&#x2014;against scurvy&#x2014; and used it to describe fresh vegetables.</p><p>Even Anson&#x2014;captain of the aforementioned disastrous voyage&#x2014;made a point of loading up on oranges whenever possible, and his chaplain, Richard Walter, described certain vegetables as being &#x201c;esteemed to be particularly adapted to the cure of those scorbutic disorders which are contracted by salt diet and long voyages.&#x201d; But while many mariners recognized that there was a connection between sailors&#x2019; diets and their susceptibility, no one knew the true cause of scurvy, or what made certain foods antiscorbutic.</p><p>Today, scientists understand the connection, and it has to do with what vitamins are actually doing in our bodies. Despite their chemical differences, all vitamins play crucial roles in our metabolism, a term that refers to the series of chemical reactions that occur in our cells. Though we are rarely aware of these metabolic chemical reactions, our lives depend on them. Walking down the street requires them. Reading a book requires them. So does forming scar tissue, developing a baby, or creating any type of new cell. Chemical reactions build and break down muscle, regulate body temperature, filter toxins, excrete waste, support our immune systems, and affect (or indeed cause) our moods. They generate the energy we need in order to breathe, and use the oxygen that we breathe to pull energy from food. They allow us to feel and see and taste and touch and hear. Our metabolisms aren&#x2019;t just a facet of our lives&#x2014; they are our lives. Without these metabolic chemical reactions, we would be as inert and inanimate as stone.</p><p>The problem with many of these reactions, however, is that they&#x2019;re way too slow&#x2014;if they were left to run at their own speed, life would grind to a halt. Our bodies get around this issue with the help of enzymes, which are large protein molecules that kick-start and speed up specific chemical reactions, often making them occur millions of times faster than they would on their own. But our bodies sometimes need help making enzymes, and enzymes sometimes need help doing their jobs. That&#x2019;s where vitamins come in: two of their primary functions are to help our bodies create enzymes and to aid enzymes in their work. While enzymes speed up chemical reactions without being destroyed, most of the chemical reactions that depend on vitamins actually use up the vitamins. That&#x2019;s why we need a continuous external supply.</p><p>It makes sense, then, that vitamin deficiencies cause problems, because without adequate vitamins, every enzymatic process that depends on those vitamins will come screeching to a stop. In the case of scurvy, the issue is collagen, a primary structural protein in our muscles, skin, bones, blood vessels, cartilage, scars, and other connective tissues that makes up some 30 percent of the protein in the human body. Collagen holds our tissues together; the word itself is derived from the Greek word for &#x201c;glue.&#x201d; Without collagen, our bodies would come apart from within&#x2014;hence the hemorrhaging, broken bones, and loose teeth of scurvy. We make collagen from its precursor, procollagen, with the help of enzymes. But those enzymatic reactions can&#x2019;t happen&#x2014;and thus collagen cannot be formed&#x2014;without vitamin C.</p><p>With that said, scientists still don&#x2019;t fully understand all the nuances of what vitamins do in our bodies, how they do it, or what the long-?term effects of moderate deficiencies might be. That, in turn, makes it extremely difficult to create precise nutritional recommendations. In the words of a 2003 report from the nongovernmental Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academy of Sciences&#x2019; Institute of Medicine, &#x201c;[s]cientific data have not identified an optimum level for any nutrient for any life stage or gender group, and [today&#x2019;s nutritional recommendations] are not presented as such.&#x201d; Instead, the same report explains that &#x201c;a continuum of benefits may be ascribed to various levels of intake of the same nutrient.&#x201d;</p><p>In fact, the RDAs themselves&#x2014;which many of us use as personalized scorecards for our diets&#x2014;are actually not meant to be personal at all. Instead, they&#x2019;re designed to meet the nutritional needs of 97 to 98 percent of all people, which means that the majority of us could get by just fine on less. (There&#x2019;s also no need to get 100 percent of your RDA every day&#x2014;what&#x2019;s important is your consumption over time, since our bodies maintain stores of most micronutrients.) And even with that generous built-in margin for error, the Food and Nutrition Board, which is responsible for updating the country&#x2019;s RDAs, still has not established adult RDAs for biotin, pantothenic acid, or vitamin K, and there are no RDAs for infants up to one year old for any vitamin.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also still surprisingly difficult to measure vitamins, whether in our bodies or in foods. Blood tests exist for several, but there are often problems with standardization (that is, results from the same sample can vary from one lab to the next), and there&#x2019;s continued controversy over what the cut off for &#x201c;deficiency&#x201d; should be. Adding to the challenge, some vitamins are stored in inaccessible places in the body&#x2014;the most accurate way to measure vitamin A would be a liver biopsy&#x2014;and our vitamin levels can vary considerably by day or by season depending on what we eat. If you eat a lot of pink grapefruit, for example, your vitamin C level will spike within hours. If you smoke a cigarette, it will drop (as will that of folate). If it&#x2019;s summertime, your vitamin D level will likely be higher than it is in the winter, when you&#x2019;re less likely to be out in the sun and usually cover more of your skin with clothing. And as if that&#x2019;s not enough, the vitamin information on food labels is often based on composites, meaning that even if you knew your body&#x2019;s precise vitamin requirements, you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to calculate exactly what percentage of those requirements were represented by the food on your plate.</p><p>But despite these continued uncertainties, we definitely know more than early explorers, who weren&#x2019;t aware of vitamins at all. As for the era&#x2019;s doctors and scientific thinkers, they not only lacked the analytical tools and chemical knowledge necessary to even conceive of a nutritional deficiency disease, but many popular hypotheses about scurvy&#x2019;s cause were still related to the ancient theory of the humors, which assumed that people&#x2019;s innate constitutions influenced their likelihood of getting sick, and that disea...</p></p><h2>Water-Wise Vegetables: For the Maritime Northwest Gardener (Cascadia Gardening)</h2><p><p> Water-Wise Vegetables shows how to grow a lush, productive vegetable garden with minimal watering.

It is a critical thinking supplement to any textbook or course. It is best used in conjunction with the Analytic Thinking Guide. Everyone thinks; it is our nature to do so. But much of our thinking, left to itself, is biased, distorted, partial, uninformed or down-right prejudiced. Yet the quality of our life and that of what we produce, make, or build depends precisely on the quality of our thought. Shoddy thinking is costly, both in money and in quality of life. Excellence in thought, however, must be systematically cultivated. Critical thinking is the art of analyzing and evaluating thinking with a view to improving it. Critical thinking is, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It requires rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcoming our native egocentrism and sociocentrism. This miniature guide focuses on of the essence of critical thinking concepts and tools distilled into pocket size. For faculty it provides a shared concept of critical thinking. For students it is a critical thinking supplement to any textbook for any course. Faculty can use it to design instruction, assignments, and tests in any subject. Students can use it to improve their learning in any content area. Its generic skills apply to all subjects. For example, critical thinkers are clear as to the purpose at hand and the question at issue. They question information, conclusions, and points of view. They strive to be clear, accurate, precise, and relevant. They seek to think beneath the surface, to be logical, and fair. They apply these skills to their reading and writing as well as to their speaking and listening. They apply them in history, science, math, philosophy, and the arts; in professional and personal life.</p><p></p><h2>United States</h2><p>Includes stories, anecdotes, poems, songs, images, and commentary from the author&#39;s multi-media concert show</p><p></p><h2>Cars Toons Mater&#x2019;s Treasury of Tall Tales</h2><p><br>Mater always has an outrageous story to tell his friends.

He lives in Rome.<br>Stephen Sartarelli lives in upstate New York.<p>To judge from the entrance the dawn was making, it promised to be a very iffy day&#x2014;that is, blasts of angry sunlight one minute, fits of freezing rain the next, all of it seasoned with sudden gusts of wind&#x2014;one of those days when someone who is sensitive to abrupt shifts in weather and suffers them in his blood and brain is likely to change opinion and direction continuously, like those sheets of tin, cut in the shape of banners and roosters, that spin every which way on rooftops with each new puff of wind.</p> <p>Inspector Salvo Montalbano had always belonged to this unhappy category of humanity. It was something passed on to him by his mother, a sickly woman who used to shut herself up in her bedroom, in the dark, whenever she had a headache, and when this happened one could make no noise about the house and had to tread lightly. His father, on the other hand, on stormy seas and smooth, always maintained an even keel, always the same unchanging state of mind, rain or shine.</p> <p>This time, too, the inspector did not fail to live up to his inborn nature. No sooner had he stopped his car at the ten-kilometer marker along the Vigï¿½ta-Fela highway, as he had been told to do, than he felt like putting it back in gear and returning to town, bagging the whole operation. He managed to control himself, brought the car closer to the edge of the road, opened the glove compartment, and reached for the pistol he normally did not carry on his person. His hand, however, remained poised in midair: immobile, spellbound, he stared at the weapon.</p> <p>Good God! It's real! he thought.</p> <p>The previous evening, a few hours before Gegï¿½ Gullotta called to set up the whole mess-Gegï¿½ being a small-time dealer of soft drugs and the manager of an open-air bordello known as "the Pasture"-the inspector had been reading a detective novel by a writer from Barcelona who greatly intrigued him and had the same surname as he, though hispanicized: Montalbï¿½n. One sentence in particular had struck him: "The pistol slept, looking like a cold lizard." He withdrew his hand with a slight feeling of disgust and closed the glove compartment, leaving the lizard to its slumber. After all, if the whole business that was about to unfold turned out to be a trap, an ambush, he could carry all the pistols he wanted, and still they would fill him with holes with their Kalishnikovs however and whenever they so desired, thank you and good night. He could only hope that Gegï¿½, remembering the years they'd spent together on the same bench in elementary school and the friendship they'd carried over into adulthood, had not decided, out of self-interest, to sell him like pork at the market, feeding him any old bullshit just to lead him to the slaughter. No, not just any old bullshit: this business, if for real, could be really big, make a lot of noise.</p> <p>He sighed deeply and began to make his way slowly, step by step, up a narrow, rocky path between broad expanses of vineyard. The vines bore table grapes, with round, firm seeds, the kind called, who knows why, "Italian grapes," the only kind that would take in this soil. As for trying to grow vines for making wine, in this soil you were better off sparing yourself the labor and expense.</p> <p>The two-story cottage, one room on top of another, was at the summit of the hill, half-hidden by four large Saracen olive trees that nearly surrounded it. It was just as Gegï¿½ had described it. Faded, shuttered windows and door, a huge caper bush in front, with some smaller shrubs of touch-me-not-the small, wild cucumber that squirts seeds into the air if you touch it with the tip of a stick-a collapsed wicker chair turned upside down, an old zinc bucket eaten up by rust and now useless. Grass had overgrown everything else. It all conspired to give the impression that the place had been uninhabited for years, but this appearance was deceptive, and experience had made Montalbano too savvy to be fooled. In fact he was convinced that somebody was eyeing him from inside the cottage, trying to guess his intentions from the moves he would make. He stopped three steps in front of the house, took off his jacket, and hung it from a branch of the olive tree so they could see he wasn't armed. Then he called out without raising his voice much, like a friend come to visit a friend.</p> <p>"Hey! Anybody home?"</p> <p>No answer, not a sound. Montalbano pulled a lighter and a pack of cigarettes from his trouser pocket, put one in his mouth, and lit it, turning round halfway to shelter himself from the wind. That way whoever was inside the house could examine him from behind, having already examined him from the front. He took two puffs, then went to the door and knocked with his fist, hard enough to hurt his knuckles on the crusts of paint on the wood.</p> <p>"Is there anyone here?" he asked again.</p> <p>He was ready for anything, except the calm, ironic voice that surprised him from behind.</p> <p>"Sure there is. Over here."</p> <p>*</p> <p>It had all started with a phone call.</p> <p>"Hello? Hello? Montalbano! Salvuzzo! It's me, Gegï¿½."</p> <p>"I know it's you. Calm down. How are you, my little honey-eyed orange blossom?"</p> <p>"I'm fine."</p> <p>"Working the mouth hard these days? Been perfecting your blow-job techniques?"</p> <p>"Come on, Salvï¿½, don't start with your usual faggot stuff. You know damn well that I don't work myself. I only make other mouths work for me."</p> <p>"But aren't you the instructor? Aren't you the one who teaches your multicolored assortment of whores how to hold their lips and how hard to suck?"</p> <p>"Salvï¿½, even if what you're saying was true, they'd be the ones teaching me. They come to me at age ten already well-trained, and at fifteen they're top-of-the-line professionals. I've got a little Albanian fourteen-year-old-"</p> <p>"You trying to sell me your merchandise now?"</p> <p>"Listen, I got no time to fuck around. I have something I'm supposed to give you, a package."</p> <p>"At this hour? Can't you get it to me tomorrow morning?"</p> <p>"I won't be in town tomorrow."</p> <p>"Do you know what's in the package?"</p> <p>"Of course. Mostaccioli with mulled wine, the way you like 'em. My sister Mariannina made them just for you."</p> <p>"How's Mariannina doing with her eyes?"</p> <p>"Much better. They work miracles in Barcelona."</p> <p>"They also write good books in Barcelona."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Never mind. Just talking to myself. Where do you want to meet?"</p> <p>"The usual place, in an hour."</p> <p>*</p> <p>The usual place was the little beach of Puntasecca, a short tongue of sand beneath a white marl hill, almost inaccessible by land, or rather, accessible only to Montalbano and Gegï¿½, who back in grade school had discovered a trail that was difficult enough on foot and downright foolhardy to attempt by car. Puntasecca was only a few kilometers from Montalbano's little house by the sea just outside of Vigï¿½ta, and that was why he took his time. But the moment he opened the door to go to his rendezvous, the telephone rang.</p> <p>"Hi, darling. It's me, right on time. How did things go today?"</p> <p>"Business as usual. And you?"</p> <p>"Ditto. Listen, Salvo, I've been thinking long and hard about what-"</p> <p>"Livia, sorry to interrupt, but I haven't got much time. Actually I don't have any time at all. You caught me just as I was going out the door."</p> <p>"All right then, good night."</p> <p>Livia hung up and Montalbano was left standing with the receiver in his hand. Then he remembered that the night before, he had told her to call him at midnight on the dot, because they would certainly have as much time as they wanted to talk at that hour. He couldn't decide whether to call Livia back right then or when he returned, after his meeting with Gegï¿½. With a pang of remorse, he put the receiver down and went out.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When he arrived a few minutes late, Gegï¿½ was already waiting for him, pacing back and forth the length of his car. They exchanged an embrace and kissed; it had been a while since they'd seen each other.</p> <p>"Let's go sit in my car," said the inspector, "it's a little chilly tonight."</p> <p>"They put me up to this," Gegï¿½ broke in as soon as he sat down.</p> <p>"Who did?"</p> <p>"Some people I can't say no to. You know, Salvï¿½, like every businessman, I gotta pay my dues so I can work in peace and keep the Pasture, or they'd put me out to pasture in a hurry. Every month the good Lord sends our way, somebody comes by to collect."</p> <p>"For whom? Can you tell me?"</p> <p>"For Tano the Greek."</p> <p>Montalbano shuddered, but didn't let his friend notice. Gaetano "the Greek" Bennici had never so much as seen Greece, not even through a telescope, and knew as much about things Hellenic as a cast-iron pipe, but he came by his nickname owing to a certain vice thought in the popular imagination to be greatly appreciated in the vicinity of the Acropolis. He had three certain murders under his belt, and in his circles held a position one step below the top bosses. But he was not known to operate in or around Vigï¿½ta; it was the Cuffaro and Sinagra families who competed for that territory. Tano belonged to another parish.</p> <p>"So what's Tano the Greek's business in these parts?"</p> <p>"What kind of stupid question is that? What kind of fucking cop are you? Don't you know that for Tano the Greek there's no such thing as 'these parts' and 'those parts' when it comes to women? He was given control and a piece of every whore on the island."</p> <p>"I didn't know. Go on."</p> <p>"Around eight o'clock this evening the usual guy came by to collect; today was the appointed day for paying dues. He took the money, but then, instead of leaving, he opens his car door and tells me to get in."</p> <p>"So what'd you do?"</p> <p>"I got scared and broke out in a cold sweat. What could I do? I got in, and we drove off. To make a long story short, he took the road for Fela, and stopped after barely half an hour's drive . . ."</p> <p>"Did you ask him where you were going?"</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"And what did he say?"</p> <p>"Nothing, as if I hadn't spoken. After half an hour, he makes me get out in some deserted spot without a soul around, and gestures to me to follow some dirt road. There wasn't even a dog around. At a certain point, and I have no idea where he popped out of, Tano the Greek suddenly appears in front of me. I nearly had a stroke, my knees turned to butter. Don't get me wrong, I'm no coward, but the guy's killed five people."</p> <p>"Five?"</p> <p>"Why, how many do you think he's killed?"</p> <p>"Three."</p> <p>"No way, it's five, I guarantee it."</p> <p>"Okay, go on."</p> <p>"I got to thinking. Since I always pay on time, I figured Tano wanted to raise the price. Business is good, I got no complaints, and they know it. But I was wrong, it wasn't about money."</p> <p>"What did he want?"</p> <p>"Without even saying hello, he asked me if I knew you."</p> <p>Montalbano thought he hadn't heard right.</p> <p>"If you knew who?"</p> <p>"You, Salvï¿½, you."</p> <p>"And what did you tell him?"</p> <p>"Well, I was shitting my pants, so I said, yeah, I knew you, but just casually, by sight-you know, hello, how ya doin'. And he looked at me, you gotta believe me, with a pair of eyes that looked like a statue's eyes, motionless, dead, then he leaned his head back and gave this little laugh and asked me if I wanted to know how many hairs I had on my ass 'cause he could tell me within two. What he meant was that he knew everything about me from the cradle to the grave, and I hope that won't be too soon. And so I just looked at the ground and didn't open my mouth. That's when he told me he wanted to see you."</p> <p>"When and where?"</p> <p>"Tonight, at dawn. I'll tell you where in a second."</p> <p>"Do you know what he wants from me?"</p> <p>"I don't know and I don't want to know. He said to rest assured you could trust him like a brother."</p> <p>Like a brother. Those words, instead of reassuring Montalbano, sent a shiver down his spine. It was well-known that foremost among Tano's three-or five-murder victims was his older brother Nicolino, whom he first strangled and then, in accordance with some mysterious semiological rule, meticulously flayed. The inspector started thinking dark thoughts, which became even darker, if that was possible, at the words that Gegï¿½, putting his hand on his shoulder, then whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"Be careful, Salvï¿½, the guy's an evil beast."</p> <p>&#x2014;Reprinted from <b>The&nbsp;Terra-Cotta Dog</b>&nbsp;by Andrea Camilleri by permission of Penguin Books, a member of Penguin&nbsp;Group (USA)&nbsp;Inc.

The novels share neither characters nor events; instead, they approach the problem of knowing people&#x2014;of mutual understanding&#x2014;in a variety of ways. Detectives faced with a murder reconstruct the crime, but not the character of the man who was murdered. Three people tell stories about a dying pilot they know almost nothing about; each story is as full of truth as it is devoid of facts. And one man looks back on his life and discovers all the people he might have been. Together, these three short novels form a readable philosophical novel unique in world literature.</p><p><b>Karel Capek</b> (1890&#x2013;1938) is generally considered the greatest Czech author of the first half of this century. He was Czechoslovakia's leading novelist, playwright, story writer, and columnist, and the spirit of its short-lived democracy. His plays appeared on Broadway soon after their debut in Prague, and his books were translated into many languages.Text: English, Czech (translation)</p><h2>Ghosts: The Complete Guide to the Supernatural</h2><p><p><i>Ghosts </i>traces the cultural and literary origins of the paranormal, reveals the secrets behind many mysterious myths and legends, and analyzes our continued fascination with visitors from the other side.

[of] a disparate people who were never united except by their resentment of a foreign conqueror.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i> Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>In <i>The Impossible Country</i>, Brian Hall relates his encounters with Serbs, Croats, and Muslims&#x2014; &#x201c;real people, likeable people&#x201d; who are now overcome with suspicion and anxiety about one another. Hall takes the standard explanations, the pundits&#x2019; predictions, and the evening news footage and inverts our perceptions of the country, its politics, its history, and its seemingly insoluble animosities.</p><p>Brian Hall is the author of three novels, including <b>I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company</b>, his acclaimed story of the Lewis and Clark expedition, as well as three works of nonfiction.An incisive and affecting Yugoslavian travelogue from May to mid-September 1991, just as the country split up and its former republics went to war. Hall (Stealing from a Deep Place, 1988, etc.) professes no solutions for the current Balkan trauma. Rather, he offers an elegy of sorts for the promise of humanism and an eyewitness account of the balkanization of mind and action. ``Even intellectuals in Yugoslavia tend to think the truth is not only knowable, but obvious,'' Hall writes, and he unravels that in lively scenes and portraits, mostly of ordinary people but also of Serbian president Slobodan Miloevi and the wearied Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovi. He describes the weirdness of Sarajevo television news, the slant of the stories dependent on the reporter's ethnicity. He traces the tortured rationalizations behind Croatians' defense of their not-so-unique language. He suggests that supportive audience members give a Serbian opposition press conference the feel of a revival meeting. Hall has a good grasp of the ironies of history (the Serbs claim the legacy of both the partisans and the Chetniks, who opposed each other in WW II) and of the present (Croatia's leading antidemocrats aren't home-grown- -they're &#x201a;migr&#x201a;s from Australia and Canada). In multiethnic Bosnia, the microcosm of Yugoslavia, he drinks local-style coffee with Sarajevans yearning for reconciliation, their cosmopolitan ``private dream'' not shared by those in the divided countryside. In Kosovo, Hall finds a bearded Albanian passing as a Serb and maintaining an eight-year secret relationship with his girlfriend from home. Only in Kosovo, Hall observes, do old rural traditions remain intact despite the ``self-vaunting'' talk about Croat, Serb, or Muslim culture. Understandably incomplete as a tale of recent history, but a worthy aid to understanding Yugoslavia's demise. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Avid readers of science fiction have long appreciated the myriad joys of returning to fictional galaxies already experienced; delighting in the ever-unfolding mysteres of Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> or Asimov's <em>Foundation</em> series, for example.<p><em>In Far Horizons</em>--edited by acclaimed author Robert Silverberg-- a veritable "Who's Who" of science fiction's most beloved and highly honored writers once again revisit the remarkable worlds they created and made famous. </p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin sends representatives of the <em>Ekumen</em> into the violent later years of a planetary civil war. Dan Simmons once again billiantly mixes allegory and space adventure in his dangerous, religion-dominated cosmos of <em>Hyperion</em>. Greg Bear reexplores his artificial universe, "The Way", from<em> Eon, Eternity and Legacy.</em></p><p>Orson Scott Card recounts the momentous first meeting of his time-and-planet-hopping protagonist Ender Wiggin with Ender's computer based, soon to be companion, Jane.Gregory Benford rockets us back to the Galactic Center, Anne McCaffrey's <em>Ship Who Sang</em> sings again, and Joe Haldeman's <em>Forever War</em> rages on eternally. Here, also, are new stories by David Brin, Nancy Kress, Frederik Pohl, and Robert Silverberg himself--each venturing further into univestigated corners of familiar galaxies to delve into the perilous mystery of being human.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest concentration of science fiction talent ever in one volume, <em>Far Horizons</em> is an unprecedented masterpiece -- one that reopens vast empires of imagination and adventure to new explorations and appreciations. It is a major SF event, sure to bring unparalleled joy to the hearts of serious fans everywhere.</p></p><p><i>Far Horizons</i> is the science fiction equivalent of Robert Silverberg's bestselling fantasy anthology <i>Legends</i>. For both books, Silverberg invited some of the most renowned authors in the field to write a new story based on their most popular series or settings. For instance, the first story in <i>Far Horizons</i> is Ursula K. Le Guin's "Old Music and the Slave Women," which takes place in the same Hainish universe as her famous novels <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> and <i>The Dispossessed</i>. Dan Simmons wrote a piece set in the realm of <i>Hyperion</i>, Anne McCaffrey turned in a Helva story from the world of <i>The Ship Who Sang</i>, and so on. <p>Like <i>Legends</i>, the list of writers in <i>Far Horizons</i> reads like a Who's Who of the genre: Le Guin, Joe Haldeman, Orson Scott Card, David Brin, Simmons, Nancy Kress, Frederik Pohl, Gregory Benford, McCaffrey and Greg Bear, as well as Silverberg himself. And like <i>Legends</i>, the authors take a page or two to introduce their stories so that newcomers won't be totally lost. The average story in <i>Far Horizons</i> is, as you might expect, a significant cut above the average SF story, although this anthology is not quite as successful as its predecessor. Authors like Le Guin and Simmons have come up with some first-rate stuff, but Card and McCaffrey have produced stories that are mediocre at best. Overall, though, the book has far more ups than downs, and serious readers won't want to miss this one. Those new to the world of SF will also find <i>Far Horizons</i> an invaluable reference when they're looking for good authors to read. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p><p>Robert Silverberg has won five Nebula Awards, four Hugo Awards, and the prestigious <em>Prix Apollo.</em> He is the author of more than one hundred science fiction and fantasy novels -- including the best-selling Lord Valentine trilogy and the classics <em>Dying Inside</em> and <em>A Time of Changes</em> -- and more than sixty nonfiction works. Among the sixty-plus anthologies he has edited are <em>Legends</em> and <em>Far Horizons,</em> which contain original short stories set in the most popular universe of Robert Jordan, Stephen King, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, and virtually every other bestselling fantasy and SF writer today. Mr. Silverberg's Majipoor Cycle, set on perhaps the grandest and greatest world ever imagined, is considered one of the jewels in the crown of speculative fiction.</p></p><h2>Secret of the Princess</h2><p>&#34;Originally published in Japan in 2015 by SHINSHOKAN CO., LTD., Tokyo.&#34;</p><p>Milk Morinaga is a fan-favorite <i>yuri </i>manga artist whose works include <i>Girl Friends, Gakuen Polizi,</i> and <i>Kisses, Sights and Cherry Blossoms Pink.</i></p><h2>Dragonhaven</h2><p>When Jake Mendoza, who lives in the Smokehill National Park where his father runs the Makepeace Institute of Integrated Dragon Studies, goes on his first solo overnight in the park, he finds an infant dragon whose mother has been killed by a poacher.</p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>.

She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.<p> </p>Grade 7 Up&#x2014;A novel set in an alternate contemporary world. Viewing dragons as fire-breathing, non-sentient animals with gigantic appetites for livestock, humans have hunted them for centuries, and now they survive only in a few wilderness havens. Jake Mendoza has grown up at one such haven, the Smokehill National Park in the American West, and has inherited his scientist parents' commitment to the park's secret inhabitants. When he rescues an orphaned baby dragon, he sets in motion a cascade of events that may eventually save these top predators from extinction. Readers will find the book to be less about the joys of the human-dragon bond and more about the challenges of raising an infant and communicating in a vastly different language. As an exhausted Jake explains, he is the first human in history to find out that a marsupial baby dragon out of its mother's pouch still expects a round-the-clock source of food, warmth, and company for over a year. Also, their telepathic communication gives Jake and his fellow Smokehill residents debilitating head-aches, and no one on either side is ever entirely sure they've got the message right. Once readers get through Jake's overdone teenage diction in the first few chapters, they will be engaged by McKinley's well-drawn characters and want to root for the Smokehill community's fight to save the ultimate endangered species.&#x2014;<i>Beth Wright, Fletcher Free Library, Burlington, VT</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the potion succeeds and Itroun bears twins, the corrigan returns seeking her fee, and Aotrou is forced to choose between betraying his marriage and losing his life.Coming from the darker side of J.R.R. Tolkiens imagination, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun, together with the two shorter Corrigan poems that lead up to it and are also included here, was the outcome of a comparatively short but intense period in Tolkiens life when he was deeply engaged with Celtic, and particularly Breton, myth and legend.Written in 1930, this early but seminal work is an important addition to the non-Middle-earth portion of his canon alongside Tolkiens other retellings of myth and legend, The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrn, The Fall of Arthur and The Story of Kullervo, a small but important corpus of his ventures into real-world mythologies, each of which would be a formative inuence on his own legendarium.</p><p></p><h2>What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause: Balance Your Hormones And Your Life From Thirty To Fifty</h2><p>Presents a safe, revolutionary, non-prescription program for women between the ages of thirty and fifty that is designed to restore and maintain gynecological health, sex drive, and energy and to slow the aging process.

They witness the competition for the new queen of the Golden Hares, in which each young female must sing to win the crown, and the old queen must then make her perilous last journey to the island of the Golden Hares. When the children hear the hares sing, they are spellbound and their hearts are bound to the hares for ever.<br><br>But others are searching for the Golden Hares, with hounds and evil intentions.

She lives in Wales with lots of animals.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Not many hear the song of the golden hare, for it only happens when the males sing to win the heart of the new Golden Queen of the Hares. But the boy and his sister are patient. They see the hares moving and they follow to watch the new queen choose the one with the most beautiful voice. A huntsman and his two hounds are watching, too. Can the children protect the old queen until she makes it safely to her new home on the Island of Golden Hares? Set in a timeless countryside, this original tale touches on themes of natural wonders and the role of human protection. The rich, musical text evokes an old-fashioned fairy-tale style. Unfortunately, the small black words set against dark or busy backgrounds are sometimes difficult to read, and the sentence breaks are sometimes awkward. Using detailed line work and luminescent earth-tone washes, Morris's painterly watercolor illustrations are at their best depicting animals. The composition often focuses on elements not mentioned in the text, revealing a different perspective. Regrettably, the lack of visual context makes the narrative confusing. The foreshadowing is sometimes too subtle, but observant readers will find visual hints in the background. This quiet story might be better appreciated by adults than children.&#x2014;Amy Seto Musser, Denver Public Library</p><h2>Crash of the Titans: Greed, Hubris, the Fall of Merrill Lynch, and the Near-Collapse of Bank of America</h2><p><b>The intimate, fly-on-the wall tale of the decline and fall of an America icon</b><br>&nbsp;<br>With one notable exception, the firms that make up what we know as Wall Street have always been part of an inbred, insular culture that most people only vaguely understand. The exception was Merrill Lynch, a firm that revolutionized the stock market by bringing Wall Street to Main Street, setting up offices in far-flung cities and towns long ignored by the giants of finance. With its &#x201c;thundering herd&#x201d; of financial advisers, perhaps no other business, whether in financial services or elsewhere, so epitomized the American spirit. Merrill Lynch was not only &#x201c;bullish on America,&#x201d; it was a big reason why so many average Americans were able to grow wealthy by investing in the stock market.&nbsp;<br><br>Merrill Lynch was an icon. Its sudden decline, collapse, and sale to Bank of America was a shock. How did it happen? Why did it happen? And what does this story of greed, hubris, and incompetence tell us about the culture of Wall Street that continues to this day even though it came close to destroying the American economy? A culture in which the CEO of a firm losing $28 billion pushes hard to be paid a $25 million bonus. A culture in which two Merrill Lynch executives are guaranteed bonuses of $30 million and $40 million for four months&#x2019; work, even while the firm is struggling to reduce its losses by firing thousands of employees.<br><br>Based on unparalleled sources at both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, Greg Farrell&#x2019;s <i>Crash of the Titans</i> is a Shakespearean saga of three flawed masters of the universe. E. Stanley O&#x2019;Neal, whose inspiring rise from the segregated South to the corner office of Merrill Lynch&#x2014;where he engineered a successful turnaround&#x2014;was undone by his belief that a smooth-talking salesman could handle one of the most difficult jobs on Wall Street. Because he enjoyed O&#x2019;Neal&#x2019;s support, this executive was allowed to build up an astonishing $30 billion position in CDOs on the firm&#x2019;s balance sheet, at a time when all other Wall Street firms were desperately trying to exit the business. After O&#x2019;Neal comes John Thain,<b> </b>the cerebral, MIT-educated technocrat whose rescue of the New York Stock Exchange earned him the nickname &#x201c;Super Thain.&#x201d; He was hired to save Merrill Lynch in late 2007, but his belief that the markets would rebound led him to underestimate the depth of Merrill&#x2019;s problems. Finally, we meet Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis, a street fighter raised barely above the poverty line in rural Georgia, whose &#x201c;my way or the highway&#x201d; management style suffers fools more easily than potential rivals, and who made a $50 billion commitment over a September weekend to buy a business he really didn&#x2019;t understand, thus jeopardizing his own institution.&nbsp;<br><br>The merger itself turns out to be a bizarre combination of cultures that blend like oil and water, where slick Wall Street bankers suddenly find themselves reporting to a cast of characters straight out of the <i>Beverly Hillbillies</i>. BofA&#x2019;s inbred culture, which perceived New York banks its enemies, was based on loyalty and a good-ol&#x2019;-boy network in which competence played second fiddle to blind obedience.<br><i><br>Crash of the Titans</i> is a financial thriller that puts you in the theater as the historic events of the financial crisis unfold and people responsible for billion of dollars of other people&#x2019;s money gamble recklessly to enhance their power and their paychecks or to save their own skins. Its wealth of never-before-revealed information and focus on two icons of corporate America make it the book that puts together all the pieces of the Wall Street disaster.</p><p><b>GREG FARRELL</b> is a correspondent for the <i>Financial Times</i>. In January 2009, he broke the news that Merrill Lynch had paid out its 2008 bonuses a month ahead of schedule, in December, even though Merrill was in the process of losing $28 billion for the year, and Bank of America needed an extra $20 billion in taxpayer funds to complete its acquisition of the firm.

The answer, according to cult hero, creator of the sexploitation film, and the man the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> once dubbed the King Leer of Hollywood, Russ Meyer, is: &#x201c;big bosoms and square jaws.&#x201d; In the first candid and fiendishly researched account of the late cinematic instigator&#x2019;s life, Jimmy McDonough shows us how Russ Meyer used that formula to turn his own crazed fantasies into movies that made him a millionaire and changed the face of American film forever.<br><br>Bringing his anecdote&#x2014;and action&#x2014;packed biographical style to another renegade of popular culture, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Shakey </i>Jimmy McDonough offers a wild, warts-and-all portrait of Russ Meyer, the director, writer, producer, and commando moviemaking force behind such sexploitation classics as <i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Vixen</i>, and <i>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</i>. This former WWII combat photographer immortalized his personal sexual obsession (women with enormous breasts, of course) upon the silver screen, turning his favorite hobby into box-office gold when this one-man movie machine wrote, directed, and produced a no-budget wonder called <i>The Immoral Mr. Teas</i> in 1959. The modest little film pushed all preexisting limits of on-screen nudity, and with its success, the floodgates of what was permitted to be shown on film were thrust open, never to be closed again. Russ Meyer ignited a true revolution in filmmaking, breaking all sex, nudity, and violence taboos. In a career that spanned more than forty years, Meyer created a body of work that has influenced a legion of filmmakers, fashionistas, comic book artists, rock bands, and even the occasional feminist. <br><br>Rich with wicked and sometimes shocking observations and recollections from Meyer&#x2019;s friends (such as colleague Roger Ebert and fellow filmmaker John Waters), lovers and leading ladies (some of whom played both roles with equal vigor), a cadre of his grizzled combat buddies, moviemakers inspired by him, and critics and fans alike, <i>Big Bosoms and Square Jaws</i> tells the voluptuous story of Meyer&#x2019;s very singular life and career: his troubled youth, his war years, his volatile marriages, his victories against censorship, and his clashes with the Hollywood establishment. In his new biography of a true maverick, Jimmy McDonough blows the lid off the story of Russ Meyer, from beginning to his recent tragic demise, creating in the process a vivid portrait of a past America.<br>The picture is midnight black.

Diez worked as his round-the-clock assistant. &#x201c;Russ said, &#x2018;Manny, I would like you to come with me today.&#x2019; We got in his car, just started driving, I guess it was about a forty-minute drive. I had no clue where we were going.&#x201d; There was no conversation. RM seemed to be in a melancholy mood.<br><br>They pulled into a large psychiatric hospital. &#x201c;Russ said, &#x2018;My mother has been in residence here for quite some time. If you wouldn&#x2019;t mind, would you please wait out here in the car for me?&#x2019; I guess he was gone forty-five minutes. He came back, his mood even more somber. We got in the car, left again, pretty much a dead silence. Eventually he said, &#x2018;My mom has been here X number of years and my sister&#x2019;s in a similar facility. Manny, I&#x2019;m really scared that I&#x2019;m gonna wind up in a place just like this.&#x2019; He just felt that was his destiny. I just listened. It was never mentioned again.&#x201d;<br><br>$$$<br><br>Meyer could be a paranoid fellow&#x2014;one crew member from his films told me RM outlawed whispering on the set because he was sure his minions were talking about him&#x2014;and he sure wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming on matters he felt were negative in any way. Even those who knew him well don&#x2019;t know much about RM&#x2019;s early life. &#x201c;He mostly talked about his war years,&#x201d; said Meyer star Tura Satana. &#x201c;I think his childhood was very lonely for him.&#x201d; Very rarely would RM volunteer any facts regarding his formative years and nobody felt permitted to pry. &#x201c;There were certain places you didn&#x2019;t go with Russ,&#x201d; said longtime secretary Paula Parker. &#x201c;Russ was a very close-mouthed guy,&#x201d; maintained Meyer&#x2019;s film distributor Fred Beiersdorf. &#x201c;He was not gonna share. But the entire family wasn&#x2019;t happy.&#x201d;<br><br>Tight-lipped as he was, Meyer certainly purported to idolize his mother Lydia. He&#x2019;d mention her constantly during interviews but spew forth nothing more than one-dimensional platitudes. &#x201c;Mother influence is extremely important and I had a great one. She defended me to the teeth, and everything her son did was right. . . . She was a very God-fearing woman who instilled a desire for success in me. . . . Anything I achieved was because of her.&#x201d; Wherever Meyer went he carried a color portrait of his mother in his wallet (usually side by side with a nude shot of his current heartthrob). Combat buddy Warren Harding recalled that whenever RM came to visit, the photograph of Lydia was front and center on the nightstand. On one trip Meyer lost the picture and he flipped until it could be located.<br><br>Meyer was no slouch when it came to looking after Mom. &#x201c;Russ was a wonderful son,&#x201d; said family friend Dolores Fox. &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t ask for anyone to take better care of his mother. He was so devoted. He paid for her every need.&#x201d; There was no joking with Meyer about his mother. Editor Richard Brummer came into the cutting room one day absently singing the &#x201c;Lydia, the Tattooed Lady&#x201d; song made famous by the Marx Brothers. A stone-faced Russ tersely muttered, &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s name is Lydia.&#x201d;<br><br>Likewise, in Lydia&#x2019;s eyes, Russ could do no wrong. &#x201c;She used to adore him, adore him so,&#x201d; said RM&#x2019;s first wife Betty. &#x201c;If I ever did anything to Russ, she would kill me. He was her idol.&#x201d; Dig a little beneath the surface of the mother-son relationship, though, and things were naturally more complex. &#x201c;She was a manipulator, his mother,&#x201d; said close friend Charlie Sumners. &#x201c;She pretty much ran Meyer,&#x201d; maintained RM&#x2019;s right-hand man, Jim Ryan. &#x201c;He just said, &#x2018;Yes, Ma, yes, Ma&#x2019; to whatever she said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We used to call her Mother Meyer&#x2014;not to Russ&#x2019;s face, of course,&#x201d; said actor Charles Napier, who felt that RM&#x2019;s relationship with his mother &#x201c;was sad and funny at the same time. Funny in the sense she was about as eccentric as he was. Sad in the sense that he worshiped her, the only human being he probably ever loved. He would say, &#x2018;She got me my first camera and she made me learn how to use it and now it&#x2019;s paying off.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>$$$<br><br>Russell Albion Meyer was born March 21, 1922. Even here we find conflict: biographer Rolf Thissen discovered two birth certificates filed twenty years apart for RM, and the first lists his name as Russell Elvan Meyer. Early photos show a dazed, chubby baby with a messy mop of hair sitting in the lap of mother Lydia, a rather solid and strong-looking brunette sporting an ornate feathered hat. Both mother and son share luminous, searching eyes. There is a shot of Russ a few years later looking rather delicate, wearing knee socks and holding an American flag. Although he&#x2019;d never admit it, RM was something of a mama&#x2019;s boy. &#x201c;He said he breast-fed til he was three,&#x201d; said Meyer star Tura Satana. &#x201c;I told him, &#x2018;Jeez, Russ, I only breast-fed til I was two.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Lydia Lucinda Hauck Howe was born March 30, 1897. In numerous articles it was reported that Lydia had been married six times, although it was nothing her son bragged about (in his autobiography, RM notes three marriage surnames for Lydia, but only in the index). Writer David K. Frasier worked on a 1990 Meyer bibliography with RM&#x2019;s assistance, and Frasier wrote a biographical sketch in which he mentioned Lydia&#x2019;s serial matrimony. A very upset Meyer claimed to have read the draft of the biography Frasier had given him while visiting his mother&#x2019;s grave, at which point he promised the dead matriarch the offending information would be removed.<br><br>Certainly Lydia&#x2019;s most significant betrothal was to William Arthur Meyer, a Missouri-born East Oakland cop of German heritage possessing a bad gambling habit. Little is known about the relationship other then the fact that Lydia was granted a divorce on April 9, 1923, a little over two weeks after the birth of their son. William was thirty-six, Lydia twenty-five, and RM&#x2019;s birth certificate lists them as both living at 1255 Santa Rosa Street in San Leandro, California. RM claimed to know few details of the breakup, stating his mother always said positive things about his dad. Only when pressed&#x2014;and only after any attempt for a relationship between father and son had failed&#x2014;did she tell him that during the court battle over child support for the then-pregnant mother, William had shouted out, &#x201c;I hope they both die!&#x201d; In his autobiography, Meyer states that in May 1988, while leafing through a baby book in which Lydia had penned a few notes, learned that his father had pressed her to get an abortion (in an earlier draft of the manuscript RM says his mother told him directly).<br><br>Over the years Meyer related a few terse, varying tales concerning his father, none of them suggesting that William wanted anything to do with his son. In one he gets the door slammed in his face attempting to visit his father; in his autobiography <i>A Clean Breast</i>, RM describes a single visit from his dad. Dressed in a swanky camel-hair coat, refusing to come in, William stood at the screen door, inquiring as to how things were going with Lydia and Russ. The visit was so casual Meyer thought it might begin one of many, but William never returned. Lydia prodded her son into attempting a visit with his father at the police station. Told that William wasn&#x2019;t there, Russ left an ashtray he&#x2019;d made for his dad in shop class. William never bothered to respond.<br><br>&#x201c;He was a bastard, he was no good, he wasn&#x2019;t worth a damn,&#x201d; said a seventy-seven-year-old RM of his dad in 1999. That&#x2019;s as far as you could go on the subject with Meyer. Jean-Pierre Jackson, Meyer&#x2019;s French distributor, first biographer, and friend, recalled RM going stonily silent when asked about his dad. &#x201c;I asked him many times about his father&#x2014;nothing. Not a word.&#x201d; But the shadow of his absentee father looms large in dumb Nazis and stupid cops in Meyer&#x2019;s films, as RM actress and longtime paramour Kitten Natividad explains, &#x201c;because his father was a German policeman. I go, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re gonna put another Nazi in this movie?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yeah, reminds me of the old man.&#x2019; He got off on that. He said it to me lots of times through the years.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>A Clean Breast</i>, Meyer does grant a few kind words for his stepdad, Howard Haywood, an ailing WWI vet whose bout with tuberculosis left him barely able to work as a furniture salesman. Howard and Lydia had one child together, the aforementioned Lucinda. RM&#x2019;s childhood friend Lou Filipovitch said Lydia treated Howard with contempt, and others told me she&#x2019;d forced her sickly husband to live in the garage. &#x201c;Howard was a quiet, gentle, pleasant man,&#x201d; said Lou. &#x201c;She ridiculed Howard Haywood constantly, called him &#x2018;whistle britches,&#x2019; &#x2018;eagle beak.&#x2019; She was brutal, absolutely brutal. She just humiliated and insulted Howard.&#x201d;<br><br>It was the Depression, and the Meyers barely got by. Lydia got $50 a month in child support from William Meyer for Russ, which was later knocked down to $35. &#x201c;When I was young I was poorer than Job&#x2019;s turkey,&#x201d; said RM, who said that his family would frequently have to &#x201c;shoot the moon&#x201d;&#x2014;skip out on unpaid rent. &#x201c;His mother always had a garden because they didn&#x2019;t have enough money to buy the vegetable...</p><h2>The Macarthur Study Bible: New King James Version</h2><p><p><b>From the moment you pick it up, you'll know it's a classic.</b> <i>The MacArthur Study Bible</i> is perfect for serious study.

Isolation in the Arizona desert also allows him the dubious privilege of self-pity. But now someone has mutated his controllable oil-eating bacteria, which were used to clean up spills, and infested the world&#39;s primary oil fields. Former FBI agent Mark Beamon, a well-paid, do-nothing official in Homeland Security, is directed to recruit Neal for damage assessment and development of an antidote. Neal participates under protest but provides a chilling prognosis: 30 percent of the world&#39;s oil is at risk, and the possible development of an airborne strain of the bacteria would send the planet back to subsistence farming. Mills, the standard-bearer for doomsday thrillers, offers another entry that is as disturbing as it is entertaining. His villains are ecologists whose initial idealism has morphed into destructive zealotry, and his heroes are as flawed as they are convincing: Beamon, who&#39;s been featured in other Mills thrillers, is a seen-it-all character who hasn&#39;t seen anything like this, and Neal is a bitter, lonely, perpetually grieving scientist, a nearly broken man trying to summon one last burst of strength. Mills has done it again: another up-all-night read (with nightmares to follow).

G.D.W. ï¿½ AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright ï¿½ AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Wright Brothers (Thorndike Press Large Print Popular and Narrative Nonfiction)</h2><p>On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot. Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did? Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading. When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed. Historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers&#39; story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2015:</strong> Most people recognize the famous black-and-white photo of the Wright brothers on a winter day in 1903, in a remote spot called Kitty Hawk, when they secured their place in history as the first to fly a motor-powered airplane. That brilliant moment is the cornerstone of the new masterful book by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough, who brings his deft touch with language and his eye for humanizing details to the unusually close relationship between a pair of brothers from Dayton, Ohio, who changed aviation history. Bicycle shop owners by day, Wilbur and Orville taught themselves flight theory through correspondence with the Smithsonian and other experts. But the brothers soon realized that theory was no match for practical testing, and they repeatedly risked life and limb in pursuit of their goal&#x2014;including when Orville fractured a leg and four ribs in a 75-foot plunge to the ground. McCullough&#x2019;s narration of ventures such as this&#x2014;their famous first flight at Kitty Hawk; the flight in Le Mans, France that propelled the brothers to international fame; the protracted patent battles back at home; and the early death of elder brother Wilbur&#x2014;will immerse readers in the lives of the Wright family. Like other great biographies before it, <em>The Wright Brothers</em> tells the story about the individuals behind the great moments in history, while never sacrificing beauty in language and reverence in tone. <em>&#x2013; Manfred Collado</em></p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams,</i> and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

Most evenings, he looks over longingly at the happy, dancing earth people, until one night when he can't resist catching the fiery tail of a comet and hitching a ride to Earth. Ungerer, ever satirical, reports the resulting frenzy of authorities upon hearing the crash landing: "The noise brought hundreds of people from a nearby town. Soldiers sped to defend the earth. Firemen hastened to quench the flaming light. The ice cream man hurried to set up his stand for the spectators." Of course, when the crowd discovers the unidentified fallen object, "statesmen, scientists, and generals panicked." Moon Man is thrown in jail, facing criminal investigation! How will he ever return to his lunar dwelling? Kids will love this quirky "there's no place like home" tale, and Ungerer's gentle, funny mocking of "important people" won't be lost on anyone.

Why does Al Gore say that it&#x2019;s okay to &#x201c;over-represent&#x201d; the dangers of global warming in order to sell Americans on his draconian solutions? Why does Michael Moore call religion a device to manipulate &#x201c;gullible&#x201d; Americans? <br><br>Where did these radical ideas come from? And how did they enter the mainstream discourse?<br><br>In this groundbreaking and compelling new book, Daniel J. Flynn uncovers the surprising origins of today&#x2019;s Left. The first work of its kind, <i>A Conservative History of the American Left</i> tells the story of this remarkably resilient extreme movement&#x2013;one that came to America&#x2019;s shores with the earliest settlers. <br><br>Flynn reveals a history that leftists themselves ignore, whitewash, or obscure. Partly the Left&#x2019;s amnesia is convenient: Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to forget an ugly history that includes eugenics, racism, violence, and sheer quackery? Partly it is self-aggrandizing: Bold schemes sound much more innovative when you refuse to acknowledge that they have been tried&#x2013;and have failed&#x2013;many times before. And partly it is unavoidable: The Left is so preoccupied with its triumphal future that it doesn&#x2019;t pause to learn from its past mistakes. So it goes that would-be revolutionaries have repeatedly failed to recognize the one troubling obstacle to their grandiose visions: reality.<br><br>In unfolding this history, Flynn presents a page-turning narrative filled with colorful, fascinating characters&#x2013;progressives and populists, radicals and reformers, socialists and SDSers, and leftists of every other stripe. There is the rags-to-riches Welsh industrialist who brought his utopian vision to America&#x2013;one in which private property, religion, and marriage represented &#x201c;the most monstrous evils&#x201d;&#x2013;and gained audiences with the likes of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Madison. There is the wife-swapping Bible thumper who nominated Jesus Christ for president. There is the playboy adventurer whose worshipful accounts of Soviet Russia lured many American liberals to Communism. There is the daughter of privilege turned violent antiwar activist who lost her life to a bomb she had intended to use against American soldiers. There are fanatics and free spirits, perverts and puritans, entrepreneurs and altruists, and many more beyond.<br><br><i>A Conservative History of the American Left</i> is a gripping chronicle of the radical visionaries who have relentlessly pursued their lofty ambitions to remake society. Ultimately, Flynn shows the destructiveness that comes from this undying pursuit of dreams that are utterly unattainable.</p><p>DANIEL J.

Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br><br>&#x2014;matthew 6:10<br><br>Utopian and collectivist ideas are as American as Plymouth Rock.<br><br>The Pilgrims, like America&#x2019;s secular communists of the nineteenth century, hoped to build a city upon a hill. And like other sectarian groups that later found refuge in America, the Pilgrims attempted to build their utopia upon communist principles. In contrast to nineteenth-century American communists, sectarian and secular, and akin to most twentieth-century Europeans living under communists, the Pilgrims&#x2019; system was imposed on them from without. The edict to abolish private property and pool resources came from an unlikely source: Plymouth colony&#x2019;s capitalist investors, who unwisely, and ironically, feared that the colonists&#x2019; private greed would eat away at investment profits. Under communism, which reigned in Plymouth colony from 1620 to 1623, Pilgrim bellies and investor wallets starved.<br><br>Historians look back and ascribe myriad causes for these lean years. But the man whom the Plymouth colonists elected as their governor more than thirty times emphasized the role communism played in the colony&#x2019;s early woes. In Of Plymouth Plantation, William Bradford wrote:<br><br>For the young men, that were most able and fit for labour and service, did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men&#x2019;s wives and children without any recompense. The strong, or man of parts, had no more in division of victuals and clothes than he that was weak and not able to do a quarter the other could; this was thought injustice. The aged and graver men to be ranked and equalized in labours and victuals, clothes, etc., with the meaner and younger sort, thought it some indignity and disrespect unto them. And for men&#x2019;s wives to be commended to do service for other men, as dressing their meat, washing their clothes, etc., they deemed it a kind of slavery, neither could many husbands well brook it.1<br><br>Rather than &#x201c;languish in misery,&#x201d; Bradford parceled land to families for private use, which &#x201c;made all hands very industrious.&#x201d; An abundance of corn replaced an abundance of hunger pangs. &#x201c;The women now went willingly in the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability; whom to have compelled would have been thought great tyranny and oppression.&#x201d;2<br><br>Bradford concluded: &#x201c;The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato&#x2019;s and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.&#x201d;3<br><br>Other religious exiles followed the Pilgrims to America. Many didn&#x2019;t learn from Plymouth colony&#x2019;s mistakes.<br><br>A recurring theme of socialists centered on schemes to play God. For Christian socialists, this involved charismatic figures claiming to be God, or at least God&#x2019;s chosen earthly representative. For atheist socialists, this involved deposing God and putting man in his place. For who else but God could be so all-knowing as to plan from afar distribution of goods and jobs to all men?<br><br>Men submitted to intrusive schemes based on the loftiest of promises: heaven on earth. Sectarian communists undertook such endeavors to prepare for the end of the world; secular communists undertook such endeavors to embark upon the beginning of the world. With rhetoric that invoked both Genesis and Revelation, the religious and non-religious utopian dreamers displayed the intellectual debt owed to the Bible&#x2014;even by ideologues who hated the Bible. Man, again and again, fell victim to the conceit of believing himself &#x201c;wiser than God.&#x201d;<br><br>The Dutch followers of Jean de Labadie awaited the eschaton in mid-Atlantic America in the 1680s. Escaping Holland as their founder escaped France, the Labadists lived communally and shared possessions. There existed a &#x201c;check on all individuals so detailed that a record was kept of how many slices of bread and butter were consumed by each person at each meal,&#x201d; Mark Holloway writes.4 The intrusions proved too burdensome to both the collective economy and the individual. By 1698, the Labadists had begun to divide their common land into private tracts.<br><br>Johann Jacob Zimmermann surmised that the world would end in 1694. To prepare for the union of heaven and earth, his followers left Rotterdam a day after Zimmermann&#x2019;s death and made off to the forests of Pennsylvania. In the tradition of spiritual orders, the members of the &#x201c;Woman in the Wilderness&#x201d;&#x2014;a name that alluded to the true church as a woman and to the book of Revelation&#x2019;s prophecy of Armageddon arriving in the wilderness&#x2014;were single-sex (all men), celibate, and uniformed. They also lived communally. Judgment Day failed to appear for humanity but came unexpectedly for Zimmermann&#x2019;s immortal successor, Johannes Kelpius. Sect members then reexamined their ideas and slowly rejoined the world.<br><br>Conrad Beissel came to America in hopes of joining Woman in the Wilderness. Finding it gone, he secluded himself in a cave and eventually launched his own sectarian community, the Ephrata Society. Launched in 1732, Ephrata became the most enduring communist enterprise in American history, lasting in one form or another into the twentieth century. The Ephratans lived as destitute monks, forgoing possessions, sex, and individuality.<br><br>In most ways, the early sectarian communities bore no resemblance to the fantasies of leftists, past or present. In several crucial ways, however, Ephratans, Labadists, and other religious communists embodied the radical&#x2019;s dream: they eschewed private property for collectivism, rejected traditional Western civilization, and envisioned earth becoming heaven.<br><br>These communities were not demonstrations to prove the tenets of socialism, but spiritual fortresses to protect inhabitants from the sinful world surrounding them. Their inhabitants were monastic rather than evangelistic. More concerned with their own salvation than humanity&#x2019;s, sectarian communists built cities beyond rather than upon hills. Sectarian communists did not intend for their communities to serve as models for replication. Secular communists nevertheless saw them as such.<br><br>Such communities flourished in America thanks to the unique qualities of the new republic. In Europe, peculiar religious sects were unwelcome where there was unity of church and state, while centralized governments, rigid class structures, and a paucity of land made separation from society possible only by the drastic act of emigration. In contrast, America&#x2019;s federalism allowed for a diversity of governments and a plethora of competing experiments. The unsettled frontier provided plenty of land to conduct experiments in communal living. Religious freedom promised that sects could go about their business unmolested by government. And the open-door policy invited those whose beliefs conflicted with the beliefs that governed their homelands.<br><br>Disaffected Europeans came through that open door. The Shakers came from England, the Harmonists and Zoarites from the German states, and the Jansonites from Sweden. A wave of secular communists followed the wave of sectarian communists&#x2014;Icarians from France, the Modjeskans from Poland, Owenites from Great Britain. Ideas, unaccompanied by masses of people, immigrated, too. Fourierism was a system made in France but tested in America.<br><br>America&#x2019;s first aliens were aliens twice over. Outsiders in their own countries for economic, religious, political, or myriad other reasons, misfits in Europe often came to America, where they found that they were misfits once again.<br><br>Jesus Christ came to America in 1774, and her name was Ann Lee. Like Jesus of Nazareth, Ann of Manchester came of humble (earthly) parentage. Neither fisherman nor carpenter, Lee did work in a cotton factory and as a cook in an infirmary (in which she was later committed). Lee never learned to read or write, so her life&#x2019;s works were chronicled by her followers. She faced persecution&#x2014;by the state in Britain, by the mob in America.<br><br>In jail, where many find Christ, Ann Lee found herself. Confined to a Manchester cell for two weeks, Lee discovered that she was the second coming of Jesus Christ. Lee additionally discovered that she did not like jail. So, at God&#x2019;s request, she left England for America. Her followers, numbering eight, naturally followed. They settled in upstate New York, performing odd jobs, until a revival swept through the area in 1780. Lee preached. Mother Ann&#x2019;s charisma, despite her strange doctrines, made converts. Inspired, she traveled and made more converts. A religious cult bloomed.<br><br>Ann Lee was the leader, but not the founder, of the Shakers. The Shakers were originally Quakers who took to ritualistic shaking, hence the redundancy &#x201c;Shaking Quakers&#x201d; or the amalgam &#x201c;Shakers.&#x201d; Their dancing and screaming disturbed the peace of cramped Manchester and later frightened the inhabitants of sparse New England towns into thinking that Indians were afoot. Ann, and other Shakers, spoke in tongues. Ann recalled how several ministers interrogating her &#x201c;said that I spoke in seventy two different tongues, and that I spoke them more perfect than any in their knowledge were able to do.&#x201d; These British men of the cloth evidently possessed good senses of humor, as they tried to goad Ann into teaching them the languages she spoke.5 In America, Ann took to randomly making accusations against strangers&#x2014;&#x201c;whore&#x201d; being a favorite taunt. She accused one man of mating with beasts and charged one young woman with living &#x201c;in whoredom with married men, young men, black men and boys.&#x201d;6<br><br>There was a message amidst the madness. Lee waged war on marriage, demanding celibacy from her followers and cleaving wife from husband upon conversion. She condemned competing religions, going so far in Manchester as to disrupt a Church of England service. She and her flock lived communally, if nomadically, and shared all. If all of this wasn&#x2019;t controversial enough to invite persecution from the riffraff, Ann preached pacifism in rural, Revolutionary-era America. The Shakers made no secret of their English origins, and Ann, a woman, claimed to be Christ. Mobs frequently beat the Shakers, with one pack of night riders absconding with Ann in a horse-drawn sleigh to engage upon her &#x201c;acts of inhumanity and indecency which even savages would be ashamed of.&#x201d;7<br><br>Jailed, beaten, committed, ridiculed, and nearly thrown overboard upon passage to America, Ann Lee died just sixteen years after recognizing herself as the second incarnation. Lee&#x2019;s followers, like Christ&#x2019;s, lived on after their messiah&#x2019;s 1784 death. From New York and New England, they spread to Ohio, Kentucky, and points beyond. For Shakers, communism was an aspect of Christianity, not something larger. Hadn&#x2019;t the apostles lived communally? It was in imitation of the early church that the Shakers wished to live after their messiah&#x2019;s death. &#x201c;The five most prominent practical principles of the Pentecost Church were,&#x201d; according to the Shakers, &#x201c;first, common property; second, a life of celibacy; third, non-resistance; fourth, a separate and distinct government; and, fifth, power over physical disease.&#x201d;8 &#x201c;If [converts] brought children into the community,&#x201d; Mark Holloway informs, &#x201c;they were separated from them, and might only see them privately once a year, in the presence of an elder, for a very brief interview.&#x201d;9 The lifestyle and religion proved especially attractive to women, who greatly outnumbered men at Shaker communities.10 Mothers escaped child-rearing burdens. Old maids found shelter from a world that offered little in the way of opportunities for self-support and much in the way of stigma. And in contrast to nearly every other religion, a woman played a central role in the Shaker faith.<br><br>And that woman, after her death, occasionally reappeared at nightly gatherings to deliver food and drink to believing Shakers, who also caught ghostly visions of Beelzebub, Indian tribes, and Arabs far from home. But such visions grew foggier as death, celibacy, and insulation subtracted from their ranks, which had peaked at about five thousand. While the first coming of Christ now claims more than two billion adherents, the second coming claims less than a dozen people in two New England states.<br><br>Though the Shaker religion failed to inspire waves of converts, the Shaker way of life inspired waves of imitators. The Shaker embrace of a proto-feminism, pacifism, and egalitarianism; the group&#x2019;s rebellion against marriage, the family, and all post-first-century Christianity; and, especially, its communities serving as proof that communism wasn&#x2019;t mere theory&#x2014;all generated interest in Ann Lee&#x2019;s religion far beyond what a small cult normally warrants.<br><br>In 1804, the Harmonists (as they called themselves) or the Rappites (as others called them) followed George Rapp to America. Father Rapp&#x2019;s six-hundred-plus flock settled outside of Pittsburgh the next year. In 1814, Rapp sought sunnier skies and greener pastures for the group&#x2019;s vineyards, so they packed up and moved to the banks of the Wabash in southwestern Indiana. Finding scorching summers, freezing winters, and malaria, the Harmonists departed the misnamed Harmony, Indiana, but not before their leader could play a crucial role in the founding of the state.11 They returned to the Pittsburgh area in 1825 and established the town of Economy.<br><br>After siring four children, Rapp forbade his followers from engaging in sex. The Harmonists grew tobacco but their leader forbade its use. Amidst this puritan atmosphere, an English visitor noted, &#x201c;during the whole time I was at Harmonie I never saw one of them laugh.&#x201d;12 The Rappites lived humbly, save Father Rapp, who dwelled in a large and ornate home. Rapp&#x2019;s &#x201c;word was law on every subject,&#x201d; wrote William Hinds, a historian of and participant in communist communities.13 Rapp&#x2019;s followers held the same godly view of Rapp as Rapp held of himself. Appearing as if he had stepped out of the pages of the Old Testament, the leader had a ZZ Top&#x2013;like beard (sans mustache), solemn countenance, and simple dress that reminded followers that there walked the genuine article. So worshipful were the Harmonists of Father Rapp that in 1805 they deeded all of their earthly possessions to him.14 In return, Father Rapp agreed to supply &#x201c;all the necessaries of life, as clothing, meat, drink, lodging,&#x201d; and should any Harmonists &#x201c;become sick, infirm, or otherwise unfit for labor,&#x201d; Harmony&#x2019;s patriarch would provide security, &#x201c;medicine, care, attendance, and consolation.&#x201d;15<br><br>The Harmonists prepared for the end of the world. It didn&#x2019;t come. But the end came for Father Rapp in 1847, and nearly six decades later for the community he started.<br><br>The Germans of the Society of Separatists of Zoar emigrated from the same area as Father Rapp&#x2019;s Harmonists. Like the Shakers and Rappites, their migration had as much to do with conditions in Europe as with conditions in America. In Wï¿½rttemberg, the Separatists played Martin Luther to the established Lutheran Church. They were Protestant Protestants. &#x201c;[W]e reject all intervention of priests or preachers,&#x201d; they proclaimed to local authorities. &#x201c;We cannot send our children into the schools of Babylon. . . . We cannot serve the state as soldiers, because a Christian cannot murder his enemy, much less his friend.&#x201d;16 They found Europe&#x2019;s intolerance intolerable, and they migrated en masse to the open spaces of the American heartland.<br><br>The Zoari...</p><h2>Where Is Joe Merchant?</h2><p>Fleeing the creditors who own his plane, Frank Bama heads for Cuba, where he meets up with an heiress to a hemorrhoid-ointment fortune and investigates the disappearance of her rock-star brother</p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1992, 0-15-196296-0<br>Published in paperback by Avon, 1993, 0-380-72118-X<br>Where is Joe Merchant?

From this far out, the city looks like it&#x2019;s about to be swallowed by the waves. <br>&#x201c;Havana is sinking,&#x201d; I say to Bebo, standing behind the wheel. <br>&#x201c;I guess Columbus was right. The earth is round,&#x201d; Bebo says without a hint of a smile on his face. He hands me a nautical chart of the north coast of Cuba. <br>&#x201c;Check the compass, and the chart&#x2014;tell me exactly where we are. &#x201d; <br>I run my finger across a dark gray band marking the Gulf Stream then up to the last little island in a chain of islands hooking south from the tip of Florida. <br>&#x201c;Key West is eighty-five miles north-northeast of us,&#x201d; I say, checking the big brass compass. &#x201c;Havana is five miles due south. &#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting the hang of it,&#x201d; Bebo says. When my father yawns, Bebo nods toward the stern of the boat. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s had enough for the day.&#x201d; <br>Papi&#x2019;s been sitting in the fighting chair almost the whole day waiting for a bite, but he hasn&#x2019;t gotten as much as a nibble. He&#x2019;s not too happy about the possibility that we might be going home empty-handed. My father thinks that if we catch a big fish on December 31st we&#x2019;ll have good luck every day of the coming year. <br>My two brothers and I always go fishing with him on that day. We usually have a few big ones to show my mother and the Garcias, our next-door neighbors when they meet us at the dock. After the fish are cleaned and put away, we eat dinner and celebrate New Year&#x2019;s eve on the boat, with the carnival music and revelers playing and dancing on the streets above us. <br>Papi stretches, then yawns even louder. Bebo whispers, &#x201c;Hurry, he&#x2019;s going to get up.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;m standing next to Papi smiling, when he starts to unclip the rod from the chair. The fighting chair is made out of steel and wood, swivels and tilts just like the ones at the barbershop, but it has no cushions. It does have straps and the hardware to clip the rod to the chair so you don&#x2019;t get pulled into the water when you&#x2019;re fighting a big fiish. <br>&#x201c;Of all the years to go home empty-handed,&#x201d; he says, looking over my head at the horizon behind me. <br>&#x201c;Papi, can I take a turn on the chair?&#x201d; I ask and look around for my brothers. I can hear Gordo and Alquilino, the oldest, buzzing around our next-door neighbor Angelita, too busy to notice that Papi has gotten up. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lot bigger than I was last year,&#x201d; I add, squaring my shoulders and standing up as straight as I can. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Julian. The fish out here are huge,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;A flick of their tail and they&#x2019;ll pull you in!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but I&#x2019;m stronger now,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I know what to do, Bebo explained the whole thing to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bebo explained the whole thing to you?&#x201d; he asks as the ends of his mustache start to rise. <br>&#x201c;From beginning to end,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And you know how good Bebo is at explaining things.&#x201d; <br>Papi looks at me, sizing me up as if he&#x2019;s never seen me before. &#x201c;So, does Bebo think you can handle a big fish?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know exactly what to do!&#x201d; I say with as much confidence as I can muster. <br>&#x201c;OK, Julian, I guess I owe you one for this morning,&#x201d; he says and squints at the setting sun. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late but I guess we have time for one more pass.&#x201d; <br>I jump into the chair as fast as I can, before my brothers can claim it, or Papi can change his mind again. <br>He changed his mind this morning and let Gordo steer the boat out of the harbor instead of me. I was already waiting at the wheel when I saw Gordo coming. <br>&#x201c;Papi, you said last night that I could take her out,&#x201d; I yelled at him, then gripped the wheel real tight. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late, Julian. Next time,&#x201d; he said as Gordo started to wedge himself in between the wheel and me. <br>&#x201c;What if there is no next time?&#x201d; I grunted, then pushed back. Papi stopped and stared at me. He looked angry. <br>&#x201c;I heard you talking to Mr. Garcia on the phone this morning,&#x201d; I blurted out. &#x201c;You said everything is changing and this could be our last fishing trip.&#x201d; <br>Papi kept looking at me. &#x201c;Not yet, Julian,&#x201d; he said, sounding more sad than angry, then Gordo started pushing really hard. <br>I could have hung on longer, but I could tell by the sad-mad tone of my father&#x2019;s voice, that it was hopeless. Besides, Gordo is bigger and stronger than I am, and he always has to win. &#x201c;This is your big chance,&#x201d; my father says as he helps me fit the end of the rod into the metal cup in between my knees. He clips the rod to the brass fittings on the arm of the chair. &#x201c;There. Now if a big fish wants to pull you in, it&#x2019;ll have to take the chair, too,&#x201d; he says as he double-checks the clips. <br>I grip the rod tight and set my feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready,&#x201d; I say confidently. <br>My father smiles at me. &#x201c;Good.

He coauthored and coillustrated the award winning juvenile nonfiction book,<i>Little Lions, Bull Baiters &amp; Hunting Hounds: A History of Dog Breeds</i> with his wife, Shelley. The couple lives in the wilds of Colorado with their pack: daughter, Harper; shih tzu, Millie; and two wiener dogs, Baron and Fritz.<br><br>Crosby (Little Lions, Bull Baiters, &amp; Hunting Hounds) turns in a tight, polished performance in this story of a dachshund that answers the call of the wild (and then redials). Crosby's paintings display a thorough understanding of his hero's boredom--and sense of adventure. Wiener Dog lies belly up in his dog bed, watching as Granny slops another can of wet dog food into his bowl; one can almost hear him groan. So when he runs away and befriends a pack of wolves, life seems ideal. "He had a new backyard and a new water dish and new squeaky toys," Crosby writes as Wiener Dog runs through the forest, drinks from a stream, and tussles with adorable wolf cubs. Ideal, that is, until the climax of the wolves' hunt; it occurs offstage, but is clearly bloody. "Yikes!" says Wiener Dog. Crosby employs an array of techniques in his visual storytelling, from the way Wiener Dog appears to run right out of spot illustrations to the hilarious contrast between the turtleneck sweater wearing dog and the slavering wolves. This wiener's a winner. PW"<br><br>"Life with Granny had become too tame" for Wiener Dog, so, inspired by a nature documentary, he takes off to the forest, finds some new lupine companions, sheds his hand-knitted doggie sweater, and becomes Wiener Wolf. That's clearly the life for him, running with the wolf pack and gamboling with the puppies-until he discovers that the pack's energetic chase of the deer isn't just for fun but for food. That's enough to turn Wiener Wolf back into Wiener Dog and send him back home to Granny, his water bowl, and a new sweater (and the occasional outing with the pups in the dog park). While the motivations for the plot turns are somewhat flimsy, the concept of a wee little sausage dog running with the wolves is amusingly incongruous, and the text plays up the contrast in short, punchy phrases. The muddy tones of the thickly painted illustrations prevent Wiener Dog from standing out as he ought to, but his lengthy form has both authenticity and humor on its side, and the fine detailed brushstrokes for fur and foliage provide depth and texture. This would actually be an effective elementary readalone for young fans of the Kevin O'Malley school of sardonic irony, as well as being an enjoyable readaloud tale to kids who understand both the lure of the wild world and the comforts of home. DS BCCB"<br><br>Wiener Dog, a sweater-wearing lap dog who lives with Granny, feels that something is missing in his prosaic lifestyle. He is losing the wag in his tail and he doesn't know what he yearns for until he sees some wolves on TV. He hitches a ride with some campers headed for the wilderness where he meets some fearsome wolves that sense the shared DNA and permit him to run with the pack. Wiener Dog quickly sheds his sweater and transforms into the brave and daring Wiener Wolf. He proudly answers the call of the wild until he witnesses the predators' fierce hunt. He then realizes that he is just Wiener Dog and that he belongs at home with Granny. After his return, he satisfies his quest for adventure in the park, where he runs with a domestic pack. Readers will enjoy Crosby's soft, acrylic illustrations that portray the wolves in a wild, realistic way while Wiener Dog is full of human emotion. Each page is rich with details and gives readers much to explore. The minimal text perfectly complements each illustration, which makes this book a good choice for early readers. Some young listeners may find the illustrations of the wolves a bit frightening, but dog lovers will especially adore Wiener Wolf. SLJ"<br><br>Wiener Dog is a bored and pampered dachshund itching to break away from his ho-hum life in the lap of his doting owner, an old-fashioned grandmother. Watching a TV show about howling wolves is the catalyst for Wiener Dog's transformation from a meek, domesticated dog in a red sweater to his alter ego: Wiener Wolf. The adventurous dachshund hitches a ride to a state park, meets up with a pack of wolves and takes a walk on the wild side as he explores fresh territory with his new furry friends. At first, the smaller dog is intimidated by the wolves, but he loses his sweater and joins the pack, making for a hilarious juxtaposition of the little dog scrambling to keep up with the much larger wolves. The dog loses his nerve as the wolves close in on a fleeing deer, depicted on a white background with loping, snarling wolves and the little dog frozen with a horrified expression. Wiener Wolf reverts back to Wiener Dog, running right out of the illustration and hitching a ride back home to Granny. The dachshund is funny in both movement and expression, and the wild-eyed wolves are suitably scary. Dachshund owners young and old will adore this. The portrayal of Granny is regrettably stereotypical, though. Running with wolves is enticing, but coming back home is always a comfort.

When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure's reclusive great-uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum's most valuable and dangerous jewel. <br>In a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then a special assignment to track the resistance. More and more aware of the human cost of his intelligence, Werner travels through the heart of the war and, finally, into Saint-Malo, where his story and Marie- Laure's converge. <br>Doerr's "stunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors" ("San Francisco Chronicle") are dazzling. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, he illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, "All the Light We Cannot See" is a magnificent, deeply moving novel from a writer "whose sentences never fail to thrill" ("Los Angeles Times").</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong> Does the world need yet another novel about WWII? It does when the novel is as inventive and beautiful as this one by Anthony Doerr. In fact, <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>--while set mostly in Germany and France before and during the war--is not really a &#x201c;war novel&#x201d;. Yes, there is fear and fighting and disappearance and death, but the author&#x2019;s focus is on the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a blind 14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside when her father disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner is a gadget-obsessed German orphan whose skills admit him to a brutal branch of Hitler Youth. Never mind that their paths don&#x2019;t cross until very late in the novel, this is not a book you read for plot (although there is a wonderful, mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book you read for the beauty of Doerr&#x2019;s writing-- &#x201c;Abyss in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of food...&#x201d;--and for the way he understands and cherishes the magical obsessions of childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or twee. Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people in trying times must decide daily between morality and survival. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Anthony Doerr is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>.

Bush&#39;s direct role in launching a conservative counter-revolution.</p><p>With its closed chambers and formal language, the Supreme Court tends to deflect drama away from its vastly powerful proceedings. But its mysteries hold plenty of intrigue for anyone with the access to uncover them. In <i>Supreme Conflict</i>, Jan Crawford Greenburg has that access, and then some. With high-placed sourcing that would make Bob Woodward proud, she tells the story of the Court's recent decades and of the often-thwarted attempts by three conservative presidents to remake the Court in their image. Among the revelations are the surprising influence of the most-maligned justice, Clarence Thomas, and the political impact of personal relations among these nine very human colleagues-for-life. Written for everyday readers rather than legal scholars, her account sidesteps theoretical subtleties for a compelling story of the personalities who breathe life into our laws. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p> Crawford graduated from the University of Chicago Law School, and was a legal affairs reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and Supreme Court correspondent for PBS's <i>NewsHour</i> before becoming the legal correspondent for ABC News. We had the chance to ask her a few questions about <i>Supreme Conflict</i>: </p><p> <strong>Questions for Jan Crawford Greenburg</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How hard was it to get the access to justices and clerks that you had for this book? Does the culture of the Court promote that kind of openness about their deliberations? </p><p><strong>Jan Crawford Greenburg:</strong> Hard! And let me tell you it took some time--they weren't flinging open the doors of their chambers for the first few years I was covering the Court. It takes awhile to build relationships and trust, and I was fortunate enough to do that during the dozen years I've been covering the Supreme Court. As for openness, I think the culture of the Court instead promotes anonymity and privacy. The justices aren't like the people across the street in Congress, or down Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House. They don't hold press conferences or solicit media coverage of their views. They speak through their opinions. I was fortunate that they also chose to speak with me for this important book about the direction of the Supreme Court and its role in our lives. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Harry Blackmun's notes must be a treasure chest for Court historians. Could you describe what you found there? </p><p><strong>Greenburg:</strong> A treasure chest is an understatement. Harry Blackmun took extraordinarily detailed notes--almost breathtaking in their scope and level of detail. (He would even write down what lawyers were wearing when they'd appear in Court to argue a case.) He recorded the justices' comments during their private conferences--when they discuss cases--and he took down their votes. And he kept all the key memos and letters that the justices would send back and forth when they were discussing a case. It was a tremendous window into the Court's inner sanctum, during some of the most pivotal years for the institution. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One of the biggest revelations of your book is your characterization of Clarence Thomas as far more influential, even in his first year on the Court, than he's usually given credit for. Could you describe what his role on the Court has been? </p><p><strong>Greenburg:</strong> Clarence Thomas has been the most maligned justice in modern history--and also the most misunderstood and mischaracterized. I found conclusive evidence that far from being Antonin Scalia's intellectual understudy, Thomas has had a substantial role in shaping the direction of the Court--from his very first week on the bench. The early storyline on Thomas was that he was just following Scalia's direction, or as one columnist at the time wrote, "Thomas Walks in Scalia's Shoes." That is patently false, as the documents and notes in the Blackmun papers unquestionably show. If any justice was changing his vote to join the other that first year, it was Scalia joining Thomas, not the other way around. But his clear and forceful views affected the Court in unexpected ways. Although he shored up conservative positions, his opinions also caused moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to back away and join the justices on the Left. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Not every Supreme Court confirmation is a battle, even when the Senate and the President are from different parties. What separates the candidates who sail through from the ones who get put through the wringer? </p><p><strong>Greenburg:</strong> The recent appointment of Samuel Alito shows a justice with a clearly conservative record can get confirmed--and even pick up some votes from Democrats. Maybe the secret is developing a reputation as a fair and nonpartisan judge on a federal appeals court. At his hearings, liberal and conservative judges who had worked with him on the appeals court testified in his behalf, as did his law clerks--some of whom were self-identified liberals. Alito was the conservative counterpart to Clinton nominee Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She had been an outspoken advocate for liberal causes (including the ACLU), but she'd developed a reputation as a fair and thoughtful judge on the federal appeals court, garnering respect from both sides. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How much do Americans know about how their federal courts work? What <i>should</i> they know? </p><p><strong>Greenburg:</strong> Most Americans, understandably, think about trials and drama when the issue of the courts is raised. But the appeals courts--and the Supreme Court--remain mysterious, even though those courts have an enormous impact on American life. The judiciary is one of the three branches of government, but its decisions take on outsized importance at times. It can provide a vital check against abuse of individual rights by government--but it also can usurp the role of the people when it reaches out and takes on issues that more appropriately belong in the purview of the other branches. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Even though you show how our expectations for where new members will take the Court are so often wrong, I'll ask you anyway: What do you expect in the next few years from the Roberts Court? </p><p><strong>Greenburg:</strong> To be more conservative than the one led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. John Roberts himself is a solid judicial conservative who believes the Court has too often taken on issues that belong in the realm of elected legislatures. He is advocating a more restrained approach, with greater consensus among the justices. In addition, Justice Alito replaced key swing-voter Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court's first female justice. O'Connor's vote often carried the day on the closely divided Court--and she typically sided with liberals on social issues like abortion, affirmative action, and religion. Alito is more conservative, and I expect to see the Court turn to the right on those and other issues.</p>Jan Crawford Greenburg is a correspondent for ABC News who covers law and politics for <i>World News Tonight</i>, <i>Nightline</i>, and <i>Good Morning America</i>.

While Grant has written separately about each of these empires, this is his first attempt to assess and compare the accomplishments of both in a single volume. He recapitulates the basic facts concisely and accurately, and provides an excellent introduction to the classical achievement, demonstrating that the civilizations of classical antiquity have had a pervasive effect on the development of the modern world. Both Greek and Roman civilizations left a substantial linguistic legacy to modern languages, and the art, philosophy, natural science, and literature of the Greeks, and the laws and political institutions of the Romans, have left an indelible imprint on contemporary civilization. Disappointingly, however, Grant provides less a fresh interpretation of the classical achievement and its impact on the modern world than a catalogue of facts that might have been derived from other sources (including Grant's many other books). Nonetheless, his succinct sketch of the continuities of classical history (for instance, the manner in which the Romans, having conquered first the Greek colonies in southern Italy and later Greece itself, were culturally transformed by the superior Greek culture) provides a more organic view of classical antiquity than that afforded by more detailed accounts. Without novel insights, but still a fine outline of the history and achievements of these ancient civilizations. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grant, author of two dozen books on Greece and Rome, attempts to show how the two cultures were "inextricably intermingled." Instead of documenting this in systematic fashion, he presents a synthesis and update of his previous writings, recast on the basis of current research. This lively, terse, engaging history is a magnificent feast, marked by Grant's flair for the revealing detail and spiked with relevance for the present. Stressed is the enormous legacy that the Greeks adapted from Near Eastern art, literature, philosophy, religion and even city-state structure. We glimpse the Roman empire as a vast multiracial society that allowed an unprecedented measure of self-realization. If history for Grant is something made by great men, he also incorporates broad influences. For example, he points out key factors that made the Greek miracle possible--a favorable climate and ample leisure for the few.

He landed a leading role in <i>Quest for Fire</i>. He won a Golden Globe for <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. And he played the title role in two <i>Hellboy</i> movies, becoming along the way an icon among sci-fi and comic book fans worldwide.<br><br>Although his name may be unknown to some, most people know Ron Perlman's face, despite the fact that for nearly half his career he's been disguised under feature-altering foam-rubber prosthetics. On his offbeat path to success, Ron has amassed nearly 200 stage, TV, voiceover, and major motion picture credits, including roles in <i>Drive</i>, <i>Pacific Rim</i>, and a six-year gig as the badass biker boss Clay Morrow in <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>.<br><br>In <i>Easy Street (the Hard Way)</i>, Ron shares his life story, starting with his up-by-your-bootstraps background in New York's Washington Heights. His father, a Swing Era drummer, gave up his dream in order to feed his sons while his mother worked as a municipal clerk. Ron's hard-earned road to Easy Street included bouts of abject poverty, heartbreaking familial episodes, and a long, often uncomfortable struggle for self-acceptance.<br><br>He sheds light on his life as a working actor and also offers behind-the-scenes insight into the working styles of internationally famous directors, including Jean-Jacques Annaud, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and Guillermo del Toro (<i>Hellboy</i> and Academy Award-winning <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>). He provides his own peek into Hollywood, up close and personal, where he has encountered the likes of Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and others. Plus, he turns his eye on the trajectory of American culture&#x2014;the good and the bad&#x2014;as observed by a man who started out in a mom-and-pop world where the arts were disseminated by individuals rather than corporations.<br><br><i>Easy Street (the Hard Way)</i> will inspire anyone who has ever dared to dream and offers a roadmap to the next generation of dreamers.<br></p><p><b>Ron Perlman</b> is best-known for his titular role in the <i>Hellboy</i> movies and his long run on the TV series <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, as well as scores of other iconic performances, including <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, <i>City of Lost Children</i>, and <i>Pacific Rim</i>.

He has consulted with a variety of groups working on network design, including Nokia, the BBC, Newscorp, Microsoft, BP, Global Business Network, the Library of Congress, the U.S. Navy, the Libyan government, and Lego. His writings have appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The Times of London</i>, <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, <i>Business 2.0</i>, and <i>Wired1.</i>New Leverage for Old Behaviors <p>Human beings are social creatures&#x2014;not occasionally or by accident but always. Sociability is one of our lives as both cause and effect. Society is not just the product of its individual members; it is also the product of its constituent groups. The aggregate relations among individuals and groups, among individuals within groups, and among groups forms a network of astonishing complexity. We have always relied on group effort for survival; even before the invention of agriculture, hunting and gathering required coordinate work and division of labor. You can see an echo of our talent for sociability in the language we have for groups; like a real-world version of the mythical seventeen Eskimo words for snow, we use incredibly rich language in describing human association. We can make refined distinctions between a corporation and a congregation, a clique and a club, a crowd and a cabal. We readily understand the difference between transitive labels like "my wife's friend's son" and "my son's friend's wife, " and this relational subtlety permeates our lives. Our social nature even shows up in a negation. One of the most severe punishments that can be meted out to a prisoner is solitary confinement; even in a social environment as harsh and attenuated as prison, complete removal from human contract is harsher still.</p> <p>Our social life is literally primal, in the sense that chimpanzees and gorillas, our closest relatives among the primates, are also social. (Indeed, among people who design software for group use, human social instincts are sometimes jokingly referred to as the monkey mind.) But humans go further than any of our primate cousins: our groups are larger, more complex, more ordered, and longer lived, and critically, they extend beyond family ties to include categories like friends, neighbors, colleagues, and sometimes even strangers. Our social abilities are also accompanied by high individual intelligence. Even cults, the high-water mark of surrender of individuality to a group, can't hold a candle to a beehive in terms of absolute social integration; this makes us different from creatures whose sociability is more enveloping than ours.</p> <p>This combination of personal smarts and social intuition makes us the undisputed champions of the animal kingdom in flexibility of collective membership. We act in concert everywhere, from simple tasks like organizing a birthday party 9itself a surprisingly complicated task) to running an organization with thousands or even millions of members. This skill allows groups to tackle tasks that are bigger, more complex, more dispersed, and of longer duration than any person could tackle alone. Building an airplane or a cathedral, performing a symphony or heart surgery, raising a barn or razing a fortress, all require the distribution, specialization, and coordination of many tasks among many individuals, sometimes unfolding over years or decades and sometimes spanning continents. </p> <p>We are so natively good at group effort that we often factor groups out of our thinking about the world. Many jobs that we regard as the province of a single mind actually require a crowd. Michelangelo had assistants paint part of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Thomas Edison, who had over a thousand patents in his name, managed a staff or two dozen. Even writing a book, a famously solitary pursuit, involves the work of editors, publishers, and designers; getting this particular book into your hands involved additional coordination among printers, warehouse managers, truck drivers, and a host of others in the network between me and you. Even if we exclude groups that are just labels for shared characteristics (tall people, redheads), almost everyone belongs to multiple groups based on family, friends, work, religious affiliation, on and on. The centrality of group effort to human life means that anything that changes the way groups function will have profound ramifications for everything from commerce and government to media and religion.</p> <p>One obvious lesson is that new technology enables new kinds of group-forming. The tools Evan Guttman availed himself of were quite simple&#x2014;the phone itself, e-mail, a webpage, a discussion forum&#x2014;but without them the phone would have stayed lost. Every step of the way he was able to escape the usual limitations of private life and to avail himself of capabilities from various professional classes to the general public is epochal, built on what the publisher Tim O'Reilly calls 'an architecture of participation."</p> <p>When we change the way we communicate, we change society. The tools that a society uses to create and maintain itself are as central to human life as a hive is to bee life. Though the hive is not part of any individual bee, it is part of the colony, both shaped by and shaping the lives of its inhabitants. The hive is a social device, a piece of bee information technology that provides a platform, literally, for the communication and coordination that keeps the colony or from their shared, co-created environment. So it is with human networks; bee hives, we make mobile phones.</p> <p>But mere tools aren't enough. The tools are simply a way of channeling existing motivation. Evan was driven, resourceful, and unfortunately for Sasha, very angry. Had he presented his mission in completely self-interested terms ("Help my friend save 4300!") or in unattainably general ones ("Let's fight theft everywhere!"), the tools he chose wouldn't have mattered. What he did was to work out a message framed in big enough terms to inspire interest, yet achievable enough to inspire confidence. (This sweet spot is what Eric Raymond, the theorist of open source software, calls "a plausible promise.") Without a plausible promise, all the technology in the world would be nothing more than all the technology in the world.</p> <p>As we saw in the saga of the lost Sidekick, getting the free and ready participation of a large, distributed group with a variety of skills&#x2014;detective work, legal advice, insider information from the police to the army&#x2014;has gone from impossible to simple. There are many small reasons for this, both technological and social, but they all add up to one big change; forming groups has gotten a lot easier. To put it in economic terms, the costs incurred by creating a new group or joining an existing one have fallen in recent years, and not just by a little bit. They have collapsed. ("Cost" here is used in the economist's sense of anything expended&#x2014;money, but also time, effort, or attention.) One of the few uncontentious tenets of economics is that people respond to incentives. If you give them more of a reason to do something, they will do more of it, and if you make it easier to do more of something they are already inclined to do, they will also do more of it.</p> <p>Why do the economics matter, though? In theory, since humans have a gift for mutually beneficial cooperation, we should be able to assemble as needed to take on tasks too big for one person. If this were true, anything that required shared effort&#x2014;whether policing, road construction, or garbage collection&#x2014;would simply arise out of the motivations of the individual members. In practice, the difficulties of coordination prevent that from happening. (Why this is so is the subject of the next chapter.)</p> <p>But there are large groups. Microsoft, the U.S. Army, and the catholic Church are all huge, functioning institutions. The difference between an ad hoc group and a company like Microsoft is management. Rather than waiting for a group to self-assemble to create software, Microsoft manages the labor of its employees. The employees trade freedom for a paycheck, and Microsoft takes the cost of directing and monitoring their output. In addition to the payroll, it pays for everything from communicating between senior management and the workers (one of the raisons d'etre for middle management) to staffing the human resources department to buying desks and chairs. Why does Microsoft, or indeed any institution, tolerate these costs?</p> <p>They tolerate them because they have to; the alternative is institutional collapse. If you want to organize the work of even dozens of individuals, you have to manage them. As organizations grow into the hundreds or thousands, you also have to manage the managers, and eventually to manage the managers' managers. Simply to exist at that size, an organization has to take on the costs of all that management. Organizations have many ways to offset those costs&#x2014;Microsoft uses revenues, the army uses taxes, the church uses donations&#x2014;but they cannot avoid them. In a way, every institution lives in a kind of contradiction: it exists to take advantage of group effort, but some of its resources are drained away by directing that effort. Call this the institutional dilemma&#x2014;because an institution expends resources to manage resources, there is a gap between what those institutions are capable of in theory and in practice, and the larger the institution, the greater those costs.</p> <p>Here's where our native talent for group action meets our new tools. Tools that provide simple ways of creating groups lead to new groups, lots of new groups, and not just more groups but more kinds of groups. We've already seen this effect in the tools that Evan used&#x2014;a webpage for communicating with the world, instant messages and e-mails by the thousands among his readers, and the phone itself, increasingly capable of sending messages and pictures to groups of people, not just to a single recipient (the historical pattern of phone use).</p> <p>If we're so good at social life and shared effort, what advantages are these tools creating? A revolution in human affairs is a pretty grandiose thing to attribute to a ragtag bunch of tools like email and mobile phones. E-mail is nice, but how big a deal can it be in the grand schem...</p></p><h2>Dog&#39;s Noisy Day</h2><p>From the moment when a bird makes its very first chirp in the morning, Dog is on the go as he barks and brays at all the wonderful animals he sees and hears throughout the day.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-Dog's third adventure takes him around a barnyard to meet the noisy animals that live there. The adorable pup wakes with a yawn, encounters a songbird outside his window, and becomes excited by the strange sounds he hears: "`COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!' A rooster crows to wake up the neighboring farm. It certainly works on Dog!- Dog tries to crow like the rooster. `WOOFA, WOOFLE, WOO!'" Children will need little encouragement to make each sound as they enjoy this lively, well-paced story. The simple, digitally enhanced cartoons are done in vivid colors and the animals are all wonderfully expressive. Dog's Noisy Day is perfect to read aloud to a group of any size. Storytime will never sound the same again.<br><i>Alison Grant, West Bloomfield Township Public Library, MI</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreS-K. Joining Dog's previous books, including <i>Dog's ABC</i> (2002), this romp begs to be read aloud: WOOF! From wake-up to bedtime, Dog's adventurous day touring a neighboring farm is filled with all kinds of animal noises. The bouncy illustrations--simple shapes outlined in black and digitally colored--and the animals' noises in large, black capital letters guarantee participation. Dog's googly eyes give him jolly character, and his enthusiasm bounds off the pages as he romps with cows, sheep, and even bees. In a satisfying wrap-up, Dog hears his favorite sound--the CLANG, CLANG of a spoon against a plate--his dinner. A delightful choice for preschool story time; the noisy response to the story will surely be, "READ IT AGAIN!" <i>Julie Cummins</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

If she makes any errors, she'll be sent to the high-security facility known as Eat-Their-Young Island. Kindle Home is different from the other places she's lived, primarily due to the dedication of the counselors and the way in which they connect with the kids. Lucy realizes that she wants to stay there, and although she manages to weather the consequences of her own impulsive tendencies, she can't control the lack of funding that threatens the Home or the arson that is causing the neighbors to become even more leery of having such an establishment nearby. Readers will root for Lucy and come away with a greater understanding of the complexities of group homes and their inhabitants. Hartinger excels at giving readers an insider's view of the subculture, with its myriad unspoken rules created by the kids, not the system. There is a touch of romance and mystery, and while those elements may be a lure for less sophisticated readers, the memorable aspect of the novel is the way it takes readers inside a system most of them have never experienced.<i>--Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She had wiggled across the line many times before, but she&#x2019;d never done anything so bold or blatant. Within a couple of years she had accumulated more than eighty million dollars. On paper that would have made her a titan. In reality she was as poor as a church mouse.</p><p>The motivation to commit the first crime came to Allison quite unexpectedly as she was sitting on an overstuffed sofa in a coffee shop close to the Boston College campus. She was working on a class project that was due the next day and was so completely focused on the computer sitting on her lap that she was oblivious of the activity around her, not even hearing the news broadcast coming from the television that was suspended from the wall opposite her&#x2014;that is, until the words &#x201c;terrible injustice&#x201d; broke through her concentration and drew her eyes up to the screen. The young male reporter seemed genuinely sympathetic as he read his story from the teleprompter. The subject was a local nursing home called Sunset Gardens, one of twenty homes for the elderly located across the East Coast, owned and operated by a corporation out of Philadelphia. The corporate home offices, he explained, kept a database with vital information pertaining to every single one of their clients. They were vigilant in protecting privacy, had all the bells and whistles installed to keep personal data iron-proof against bugs and viruses, and had paid a hefty salary to a tech whose only job was to monitor the system. None of that mattered, though. Their system had been hacked, and the identities of all the residents in all twenty facilities were stolen with one keystroke. And because First National was designated as the official bank for all Sunset Garden homes and their residents, within minutes its accounts were wiped out as well.</p><p>The reporter went on to point out that a large number of the residents had no family to help them, and while the money in First National was FDIC insured, it could take the authorities a good long while to sort through the facts and reimburse every account.</p><p>What were the residents supposed to do until then? Allison wondered.</p><p>A sense of outrage was growing inside her as she listened to the catastrophic details of the crime, but the tragedy hit home when the reporter played a clip of his interview with one of the elderly residents. Her name was Ella O&#x2019;Connor. He knelt beside Ella&#x2019;s wheelchair and held her veiny hand as he asked her what the news meant to her.</p><p>Ella&#x2019;s watery eyes stared at the reporter for a moment as though she was trying to understand the question. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said. And then a look of despair crossed her face. &#x201c;I hope they don&#x2019;t make me leave.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella was all alone, afraid, and feeling helpless. Allison knew exactly how that felt. Her heart went out to Ella and all the other poor souls. Some of them would die before it was all sorted out, and in their golden years dealing with such stress and fear would be traumatic. What had happened to them was beyond cruel.</p><p>An interview with the president of the Sunset Gardens Corporation was played next. With a shrug in his voice he said, &#x201c;The authorities told me it was most likely the Russians behind the hacking. Or possibly the Chinese. The truth is, we may never know.&#x201d;</p><p>His defeated &#x201c;Oh well, what can you do?&#x201d; attitude infuriated Allison. She knew the FBI had experts trying to locate the hackers and shut them down, but it was apparent they hadn&#x2019;t had any luck so far. The invasion of secure systems was becoming an epidemic. Just the week before, the news agencies had announced that the Pentagon had been hacked. The FBI was certain the Russians were behind the theft of employee information then as well, but proving it was a huge challenge.</p><p>What could she do? Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe. It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to try to find the Sunset Garden hackers, would it?</p><p>Was it her ego or arrogance that made her think she might succeed? She had always had the ability to solve complex problems. Even at an early age her thought processes were out of the box. She was just eight years old when her uncanny ability was first noticed. Her older sister, Charlotte, had bought a five-hundred-piece jigsaw puzzle at a yard sale and placed all the tiny pieces on the floor in their room. When Allison came home from school, Charlotte asked her if she wanted to help put the puzzle together. Allison knelt on the floor and stared at the scattered pieces for no more than a minute or two while her brain studied them. Not only could she tell Charlotte what the picture was, but she knew where the pieces fit. It was as though she was watching each part of the puzzle connect to the next. After separating the tiny cardboard tiles into six piles, she went to work. Charlotte watched in amazement. In less than five minutes, Allison had the perimeter of the square picture put together, and within another twenty, the entire puzzle was completed. Allison didn&#x2019;t think she had accomplished anything unusual, but Charlotte was clearly impressed. She told Allison that most people didn&#x2019;t look at things the way she did.</p><p>The nursing home story broke just as Christmas break was coming up. Allison was a sophomore at Boston College at the time and planned to spend the holiday alone. Charlotte and her husband, Oliver, had moved to Seattle a couple of years ago.&nbsp; They had offered to buy a plane ticket for her to come, but knowing they were saving up to buy a house, Allison declined their generosity. &nbsp;Allison&#x2019;s only other relatives were her aunt and uncle, and she would rather have slept on the street than spent the holiday with them.</p><p>Allison and Charlotte had been very young when Aunt Jane and Uncle Russell became their legal guardians. The couple had one son, Will, who was two years older than Allison, and the atmosphere of their home was neither warm nor welcoming. An air of constant friction permeated the place, usually stemming from something Will had done. He never showed any signs of ambition or responsibility, and he hung around with a group of creepy misfits. The only talent he seemed to have was a knack for getting into trouble&#x2014;or mischief, as Uncle Russell called his skirmishes with the police.</p><p>To Allison, her aunt and uncle and cousin were her poor excuse for relatives. Charlotte was her only family. When they were children, their aunt had often threatened to split them up if they didn&#x2019;t obey and keep quiet, and the possibility of never seeing her sister again had terrified Allison. She&#x2019;d felt so helpless. She would have done anything to keep that from happening. Her fear, plus her sense of obligation to them for taking Charlotte and her into their home when they had nowhere else to go, had kept her compliant. However, now that she was an adult and had moved away from their house, she felt a new sense of freedom.</p><p>Since Allison was spending the holiday vacation alone, she decided to use the time off to focus her full attention on the hackers. She was confident the vast forces at the FBI would find the culprits eventually, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to leave the task to them. It could take too long.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t get very far in her search during break, yet she didn&#x2019;t give up. Every moment of spare time she could steal between her classes was spent on her hunt. She was well aware of the chance she was taking, and she knew how careful she had to be. Breaking into protected sites was against the law, and yet she wasn&#x2019;t deterred. She couldn&#x2019;t get the elderly victims out of her mind. Finding their money was becoming an obsession.</p><p>A breakthrough came when she gained access to the bank&#x2019;s servers and tracked the thief&#x2019;s withdrawals to various bank accounts that had been set up in a number of European countries. As she suspected, those had been closed within seconds of the deposits, and the money was routed to other accounts. Ultimately she traced the funds to a consolidated account in the Ukraine, and from there it was dispersed once again into smaller bank accounts. With each discovery, she became more and more certain the attack was not carried out by a cyber syndicate, but rather by a small group of hackers or maybe even a lone wolf, someone who had devised an elaborate plan to find a vulnerable target and drain the funds before anyone could detect the theft. Step by step, she unraveled the knots.</p><p>After a month of searching she hadn&#x2019;t found the source, but she could feel she was closing in. A long weekend was coming up and she was excited to have the extra time. The minute her classes ended on Friday afternoon, she hurried to her house off campus to resume her quest. Changing into her favorite fleece sweats and fuzzy slippers, she propped pillows against the bed&#x2019;s headboard and leaned back, her laptop on her outstretched legs. Around three in the morning, just as she was about to call it quits for the night, she found the last link&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and presto, she had them.</p><p>Her discovery surprised her. The theft wasn&#x2019;t carried out by the Russians or the Chinese after all. All of the routing and rerouting through foreign banks turned out to be just a clever way of diverting attention. The real source was actually on the West Coast of the United States. The hackers were two seniors and one grad student at Stanford University. Their carefully hidden accounts, all containing some form of their initials, CHF, for their first names, Charles, Harold, and Franklin, had a total of thirty-eight million dollars. Certainly not chump change by any hacker&#x2019;s standards.</p><p>Allison was euphoric for a good fifteen minutes before worry set in. The way the three men moved money around was a concern. That thirty-eight million could be gone by morning, and she would have to spend God knows how long tracking it down again.</p><p>She knew what she needed to do. She just didn&#x2019;t know if she had the courage to do it. If she messed up, she could get thirty years in prison, she thought, even as she realized she couldn&#x2019;t and wouldn&#x2019;t let those three greedy lowlifes take what didn&#x2019;t belong to them.</p><p>&#x201c;Screw it,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how you like feeling helpless.&#x201d;</p><p>She could imagine how angry they were going to be when they realized they had been hacked, and thinking about it made her smile.</p><p>The first thing she did was steal the money. All thirty-eight million. She put it in a secure account she made certain they would never be able to find, then set about gathering the proof to nail them. She carefully retraced each step they&#x2019;d taken, including each routing number, each transfer number, and each account number. Once that was done and the proof was indisputable, she sent the evidence and the thirty-eight million to the FBI. She, of course, made certain the e-mail she was about to send couldn&#x2019;t be traced back to her.</p><p>&#x201c;This is for you, Ella,&#x201d; she said as she triple-checked her work, then typed the e-mail address for the FBI cyber task force and hit send.</p><p>Her message for the FBI was to the point. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just a possibility anymore. He hated when a hunch became a reality.</p><p>Liam Scott walked through the bar of the beach hotel and spotted his friend and colleague Alec Buchanan sitting outside on the veranda. The stars were so bright in the vast Honolulu sky the tiny lights strung overhead between the palms were almost redundant.</p><p>Alec had changed from his work clothes and was wearing a pair of cargo shorts, worn-out loafers, and an old T-shirt that was so faded the name of the 5K charity race it was promoting was illegible. He was leaning back in his chair with his legs outstretched, holding a beer, and watching the surf&#x2019;s hypnotic ebb and swell. He looked as though he was a tourist on the tail end of a long relaxing vacation and not an agent who had just completed one of the most intense investigations of his FBI career.</p><p>Liam hadn&#x2019;t changed out of his suit yet. When he reached Alec, he took his phone from his pocket and laid it on the table, then removed his jacket and tie, draping them on the back of the rattan chair before unbuttoning his collar.</p><p>&#x201c;I ordered you a Guinness,&#x201d; Alec told him.</p><p>Liam dropped into the chair. &#x201c;Thanks. I could use one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like we should have this wrapped up tomorrow. Just as long as Meyer doesn&#x2019;t get cold feet.&#x201d; He tipped his bottle to Liam in salute and said, &#x201c;I appreciate your coming in on this case. I don&#x2019;t think we could have located Meyer without you and your international connections.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If Meyer&#x2019;s testimony brings down Dimitri Volkov and his syndicate, that&#x2019;s all the thanks I need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was surprised we got him to turn so quickly. I thought he&#x2019;d hold out longer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no spring chicken. I guess the thought of the rest of his life in maximum security was enough of an incentive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is he now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The team&#x2019;s helping him pack up, and they&#x2019;ll be moving him into a safe house. If they can keep him under wraps long enough, Volkov and his army of lawyers won&#x2019;t be able to line up a defense. They&#x2019;ll never suspect that Meyer is going to testify against his old partner.&#x201d;</p><p>A waitress appeared and set a glass of the murky dark brew in front of Liam. She was wearing a yellow bikini. A colorful scarf tied around her waist created a wrap that was so short it barely covered her firm little derriere. She wore no shoes, and Liam eyed her long tan legs appreciatively.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anything else I can get you?&#x201d; she asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; Liam answered.</p><p>She lingered for a moment and slid her gaze up and down his body. She then gave him a seductive smile and said, &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s anything I can do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you just let me know, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>Liam and Alec watched her saunter back to the bar. She took her time to make sure the men got a good look at her attributes.</p><p>Alec gave Liam&#x2019;s leg a nudge with his foot. &#x201c;I think that was an invitation. You might find Honolulu is a very friendly place after all.&#x201d;</p><p>Liam laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving early tomorrow. I think a good night&#x2019;s sleep is what I need.&#x201d; He lifted the glass to his lips and took a couple of gulps. &#x201c;When are you going home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fly back to Chicago on Friday. Regan&#x2019;s birthday is on Saturday. She doesn&#x2019;t expect me home until next week, and I want to surprise her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it. Regan is beautiful and smart and funny and sweet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why that perfect woman married you, I&#x2019;ll never know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. She is perfect. Finding Regan was the best thing that ever happened to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lucky man,&#x201d; Liam said.</p><p>Alec nodded. &#x201c;Yes, I am. What about you? Aren&#x2019;t you about ready to find the right woman and settle down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Settle. Now, that&#x2019;s the operative word.

Despite the fact she lived in an age in which women were regarded as little more than chattel, Eleanor managed to defy convention as she exercised power in the political sphere and crucial influence over her husbands and sons. In this beautifully written new biography, Alison Weir, author of five widely acclaimed chronicles of England's royal rulers, paints a vibrant portrait of this truly exceptional woman, and provides new insights into her intimate life.<br><br>Born in 1122 into the sophisticated and cultured court of Poitiers, Eleanor came of age in a world of luxury, intrigue, bloody combat, and unbridled ambition. At only fifteen, she inherited one of the great fortunes of Europe--the prize duchy of Aquitaine--yet her father had been shrewd enough to realize that her future security lay in a powerful marriage. Consequently the sensual Duchess submitted to a union with the handsome but sexually withholding Louis VII, the teenage king of France. The marriage endured for fifteen fraught years, until Eleanor finally succeeded in having it annulled--only to enter an even stormier match with the aggressively virile, hot-tempered Henry of Anjou, who would soon ascend to the English throne as Henry II.<br><br>As Weir traces the fascinating intersection of public and private lives in Europe's twelfth-century courts, Eleanor comes to life as a complex, boldly original woman who transcended the mores of society. Eventually, after enduring Henry's flagrant infidelities, she showed herself a formidable and dangerous enemy of the King's interests by plotting to overthrow him with their sons Henry, Richard, and Geoffrey. A tireless political fighter and a born survivor, the humbled Queen emerged from sixteen years of imprisonment, age sixty-seven, to rule England with wisdom and panache during the absence of her son, King Richard the Lion Heart, while he fought in the ruinous Third Crusade.<br><br>Eleanor of Aquitaine lived a long life of many contrasts, of splendor and desolation, power and peril, and in this stunning biography, Alison Weir captures the woman--and the queen--in all her glory. With astonishing historic detail, mesmerizing pageantry, and irresistible accounts of royal scandal and intrigue, Weir recreates not only a remarkable personality but a magnificent past era. Eleanor of Aquitaine is the crowning achievement of an extraordinary career.</p><p>Combining the pace and descriptive quality of a novel with the authority of a textbook, Alison Weir's study of the revered and reviled Eleanor of Aquitaine should be valuable to anyone with an interest in medieval European history. Wife of Louis VII of France and subsequently of Henry II of England, and mother of Richard "the Lion-Hearted," Eleanor played a prominent part in the politics of the 12th century. The author of a number of other books on the medieval period (<i>Life of Elizabeth I</i>, <i>The Children of Henry VIII</i>), Weir brings all the color and ever-present dangers of Eleanor's world to life, filling the text with absorbing background detail and revelatory contemporary anecdotes. She is concerned throughout to make critical analysis of the primary sources, the later myths about Eleanor, and other modern biographies. This results in a fresh and thoughtful perspective on the energetic life of a determined and ambitious woman living with the sexism, excesses, and violence of a society in which the word of a single man could condemn thousands to death. <i>Eleanor of Aquitaine</i> is a vivacious but scholarly book with extensive notes and references, giving an objective and rich account of the staunch Eleanor, her feuding family and her complex and unstable world. <i>--Karen Tiley, Amazon.co.uk</i><p>"Her biography reads like a medieval romance, a marvellous intermingling of fact with legend--fascinating-- splendid." - Literary Review</p> <br> <p>"Triumphantly done." - Sunday Times</p></p><h2>The Wouldbegoods (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>Determined to be well-behaved children, the Bastables form a pact to be helpful to others, but their good intentions lead them into unexpected troubles</p><p>She was born in 1858 at 38 Lower Kennington Lane in Kennington, Surrey (now part of Greater London), the daughter of a schoolteacher, John Collis Nesbit, who died in March 1862, before her fourth birthday. Her sister Mary&#39;s ill health meant that the family moved around constantly for some years, living variously in Brighton, Buckinghamshire, France (Dieppe, Rouen, Paris, Tours, Poitiers, Angouleme, Bordeaux, Arcachon, Pau, Bagneres de Bigorre, and Dinan in Brittany), Spain and Germany, before settling for three years at Halstead Hall in Halstead in north-west Kent, a location which later inspired The Railway Children. When Nesbit was 17, the family moved again, this time back to London, living variously in South East London at Eltham, Lewisham, Grove Park and Lee. A follower of William Morris, 19-year-old Nesbit met bank clerk Hubert Bland in 1877. Seven months pregnant, she married Bland on 22 April 1880, though she did not immediately live with him, as Bland initially continued to live with his mother. Their marriage was an open one. Bland also continued an affair with Alice Hoatson which produced two children (Rosamund in 1886 and John in 1899), both of whom Nesbit raised as her own. Her own children were Paul Bland (1880-1940), to whom The Railway Children was dedicated; Iris Bland (1881-19??); and Fabian Bland (1885-1900), who died aged 15 after a tonsil operation, and to whom she dedicated Five Children And It and its sequels, as well as The Story of the Treasure Seekers and its sequels. Nesbit and Bland were among the founders of the Fabian Society (a precursor to the Labour Party) in 1884. Their son Fabian was named after the society. They also jointly edited the Society&#39;s journal Today; Hoatson was the Society&#39;s assistant secretary. Nesbit and Bland also dallied briefly with the Social Democratic Federation, but rejected it as too radical. Nesbit was an active lecturer and prolific writer on socialism during the 1880s. Nesbit also wrote with her husband under the name &#34;Fabian Bland&#34;, though this activity dwindled as her success as a children&#39;s author grew. Nesbit lived from 1899 to 1920 in Well Hall House, Eltham, Kent (now in south-east Greater London). On 20 February 1917, some three years after Bland died, Nesbit married Thomas &#34;the Skipper&#34; Tucker, a ship&#39;s engineer on the Woolwich Ferry.In this sequel to THE TREASURE SEEKERS, the Bastable siblings spend a summer making mischief in the English countryside. The wonderfully imaginative children form a society for the doing of good deeds--with unfailingly disastrous and amusing results. Their adventures (seamlessly abridged) are presented as vignettes with snatches of music in between. Teresa Gallagher sounds unerringly like children should sound. She's completely convincing as both the boys and the girls (and the grown-ups)--and she's particularly successful in the narrating voice of Oswald, who is the anonymous teller of these adventures. Edith Nesbit's strikingly modern British classic is just as welcome--and feels just as relevant--today.

Pushed by a domineering mother, Carmel McBain climbs her way through the pecking order and ends up at London University as an acquiescent and undernourished teenager, achieving the status so desired by her mother, but too weak to make use of it or pose a threat to anyone. Though this is Carmel's story, it reflects on a generation of girls desiring the power of men, but fearful of abandoning what is expected and proper.Carmel McBain is the only child of working-class Irish-Catholic parents. Her mother aspires to something more for her than what life in their depressed mill town has to offer. She is ambitious for her daughter, determined that she slip through England&#39;s rigid social barriers. And so, early on, she pushes Carmel, first to gain a scholarship to the local convent school, then to sit the exams for a place at London University. And Carmel does not disappoint. But success carries with it a fearful price. It sets her on a lonely journey that will take her as far as possible from where she began, uprooting her from the ties of class and place, of family and faith. Uprooting her ultimately from her own self. A coming-of-age novel, a memoir of a Catholic childhood, a piercing and witty look at social pretensions, a story of lost possibilities and girlhood betrayals: perhaps only a novelist of Hilary Mantel&#39;s enormous talents could have taken such material and shaped it into so fresh and arresting a tale.</p><h2>The Tarot</h2><p>This scholarly work creates a new epoch in traditional occult philosophy.

Guggenheim Museum, New York and The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, this comprehensive volume illuminates the origins and motivations of James Turrell&#39;s incredibly diverse and exciting body of work--from his Mendota studio days to his monumental work-in-progress Roden Crater. Whether he&#39;s projecting shapes on a flat wall or into the corner of a gallery space, James Turrell is perpetually asking us to &#34;go inside and greet the light&#34;--evoking his Quaker upbringing. In fact, all of Turrell&#39;s work has been influenced by his life experiences with aviation, science, and psychology, and as a key player in Los Angeles&#39;s exploding art scene of the 1960s. Enhanced by thoughtful essays and an illuminating interview with the artist, this monograph explores every aspect of Turrell&#39;s career to date--from his early geometric light projections, prints, and drawings, through his installations exploring sensory deprivation and seemingly unmodulated fields of colored light, to recent two-dimensional experiments with holograms. It also features an in-depth look at Roden Crater, a site-specific intervention into the landscape near Flagstaff, Arizona, which will be presented through models, plans, photographs, and drawings. Fans of this highly influential artist will find much to savor in this wide-ranging and beautiful book, featuring specially commissioned new photography by Florian Holzherr.</p><p>Copublished with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the major touring retrospective and concurrent exhibitions at the Solomon R.

Even the briefest "grace" spoken before dinner offers its time-honored wisdom. Yet in spite of hundreds of traditions and teachings and books about prayer, millions of Americans have become ambivalent about it. They are unsure how, when, where, and even why they might pray, afraid they&#x2019;ll do it wrong, or worried that they won&#x2019;t be heard. <p>Writing in the beautiful, funny, honest narrative style that moved and inspired readers of her first book, <i>Here If You Need Me, </i>Kate Braestrup explains what prayer is and the many ways we can pray. With an approach that is both personal and inclusive, <i>Beginner&#x2019;s Grace </i>is a new kind of prayer book. Even if you don&#x2019;t pray and don&#x2019;t consider yourself religious, there&#x2019;s room in this book for you. In these pages, Braestrup explains how and why the practice of prayer can open a space in our busy lives for mindfulness, gratitude, contentment, and a wider compassion toward others. </p><p>Inspired by her work as a chaplain, Braestrup includes many examples of prayers to draw from&#x2014;beginning with grace, a brief prayer of thanks. She provides clear models and practical suggestions for making your own and your family&#x2019;s prayers meaningful and satisfying, and offers prayers for situations in which words might fail: times of anxiety, helplessness, or grief. And she invites you to explore forms of prayer that extend into the wider community, including prayer with and for people we don&#x2019;t like or with whom we disagree.</p><p>&nbsp;A welcoming modern guide to the simplest, most effective way to satisfy a universal spiritual hunger, <i>Beginner&#x2019;s Grace </i>is for the religious and nonreligious and even irreligious in its generous, good-humored approach to spirituality. With its insight and warmth, <i>Beginner&#x2019;s Grace </i>is sure to become a spiritual touchstone for people of all faiths</p></p><p>Susan Ericksen is an actor and a voice-over artist.

She had given birth that afternoon to her third child after a difficult and perhaps not altogether welcome pregnancy.</p><p>She had already struggled through one major bout of depression, was having severe back pain from an old injury, and was overwhelmed by the demands of her two small boys. On top of this, she had an emotionally demanding job working with abused children. Because of her medical conditions and &#x201c;advanced age,&#x201d; her pregnancy was considered high-risk, which meant she had to drive two hours to a specialist every week for prenatal care.</p><p>Still, the day before, when I had bumped into Ruth at the community pool, she had seemed pretty upbeat. The water was entertaining her children and helping to support the weight of her belly, and as we chatted, she cheerfully told me that she thought she might already be in early labor.</p><p>Baby Nina was born that afternoon by cesarean section, and all had apparently gone well. The other children and Ruth&#x2019;s husband, Wally, had come for a visit and then gone home. That was when, Ruth told me, things started to get strange. The baby wasn&#x2019;t responding well to tests; her oxygen levels were lower than they should have been. Ruth was told that Nina would have to be taken to the neonatal intensive care nursery for a more extensive evaluation. The nurse who escorted Ruth back to her hospital room was silent while Ruth climbed into bed. On her way out, the nurse turned in the doorway and regarded Ruth for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;And then she told me to pray,&#x201d; Ruth said.</p><p>With clumsy, sleepy fingers, I was fitting a white vinyl tab into the collar of my black shirt. The white parallelogram it made at my throat would declare me as clergy.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Ruth,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;She said that was my job right now,&#x201d; Ruth went on. &#x201c;To pray for my baby girl. I&#x2019;m really sorry to wake you up in the middle of the night, but I don&#x2019;t know what she meant. I don&#x2019;t even know how to pray... and I thought maybe, because you&#x2019;re... you know, a minister... maybe you could just tell me, like, really quickly: How do I pray for my baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I am ordained in a particular form of ministry known as &#x201c;community ministry.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t serve in a church, but rather, along with a growing company of clergy, I serve diverse populations out &#x201c;in the world.&#x201d; Some of us spend our time among the homeless, others as chaplains serving in the military, in hospitals, or with firefighters, police officers, and other first responders. As chaplain to the Maine Warden Service, the agency that polices the state&#x2019;s roughly seventeen million acres of wildland, I accompany game wardens to accidents and drownings and search-and-rescue operations in the Maine woods. Regardless of the circumstances, community ministry brings us into close contact with people whose socioeconomic and religious backgrounds vary widely, and who may share with us little more than birth, illness, and death&#x2014;the common features of human experience. Whatever theological or doctrinal systems a chaplain begins his ministry with, the work itself has a distinctly streamlining effect. A chaplain doesn&#x2019;t have a leisurely hour in which to explain God. The suffering is right there, and its urgency demands an immediate response. We don&#x2019;t give a lot of sermons out in the field or in the woods or streets. Instead, we are called upon to offer the spiritual equivalent of triage. We&#x2019;re asked to pray.</p><p>Arriving at the hospital&#x2019;s neonatal nursery, I expected to see a desperately sick little creature in an incubator. Instead, Nina was stretching and kicking her newborn legs, a lively, lovely baby girl, while a doctor in a white lab coat pressed a stethoscope to her stout little chest. In fact, despite the initially worrying signs, Nina turned out to be fine.</p><p>So what on earth was that nurse thinking? To tell the mother of a newborn &#x201c;You should pray,&#x201d; can only be interpreted as &#x201c;Your baby is in terrible, terrible trouble.&#x201d; Was the nurse an insensitive religious wacko?</p><p>No. She was a human being who had just made a mistake. Among the medicines Ruth had taken for her back pain was methadone. When the nurse reviewed Ruth&#x2019;s file after the baby seemed to have trouble breathing, she saw the drug and jumped to the wrong conclusion: She had thought that Ruth was a heroin addict who had traveled to Bangor, where there is a methadone clinic, throughout her pregnancy.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t really an excuse for psychological cruelty, but it is an explanation: The nurse thought she was dealing with (yet another) substance abuser whose bad choices were inflicting harm on her own helpless offspring. I have felt the same frustration when witnessing catastrophic parental failures in my work as a chaplain.</p><p>I could leave it at that&#x2014;Ruth had been the victim of misdirected and inappropriate anger. She wasn&#x2019;t responsible for her baby&#x2019;s troubles, which, in any case, had proved both mild and transient. Ruth didn&#x2019;t need to pray. Except that she did need to pray. The nurse&#x2019;s exhortations, right or wrong, had triggered an instinctive reaction. What&#x2019;s more, Ruth <i>wanted</i> to pray but didn&#x2019;t know how.</p><p>So I helped Ruth to pray. Here is the prayer we offered together.</p><blockquote><p></p><p>HOSPITAL PRAYER</p><p>O God, whose name is love</p><p>I offer the prayer of my yearning heart</p><p>I can&#x2019;t hold or heal my child.</p><p>Please, hold her for me.</p><p>Love moves in the skilled hands of those who would heal my baby</p><p>Love is in their learning and their care</p><p>God be in my understanding.</p><p>God be in my patience</p><p>God be in my arms, as she is returned to me.</p><p>May my child and all children be blessed</p><p>My family and all families blessed</p><p>May God&#x2019;s love enfold us, dwell in us, give us comfort</p><p>And grant us peace.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>KB</p></blockquote><p>When I invented this Hospital Prayer, more or less on the spot for Ruth and Nina, I drew it from a well that I&#x2019;d spent years digging. There was a time when I would have imagined that, having dug my well, I could also claim credit for the water.</p><p>Why would it occur to Ruth to pray, and how would she know how to do it? Like Ruth&#x2019;s family, my family of origin did not pray and only rarely went to church. I learned enough about religion to be politely silent when prayers were offered at the services I visited with friends and at weddings or funerals. The same culture that taught me both &#x201c;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#x201d; and &#x201c;Glory! Glory! Hallelujah, Teacher hit me with a ruler&#x201d; taught me the words of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, but it never occurred to me to actually say it. That is, to <i>pray</i> it.</p><p>In my early twenties, I felt an unfocused longing&#x2014;not new but never so acute&#x2014;that made itself known to me through the insistent if prosaic passions of a young woman who took herself and her life very (and probably too) seriously: the intensity of my love for my husband, the moment when another human being gave his first flutter of greeting from deep within my body, and then in the bloody drama of childbirth.</p><p>I wanted to name the longing and respond somehow to its source, by some magnificent gesture if possible, but at least with a moment&#x2019;s deliberate attention. No nurse was around to tell me that what I wanted was to pray.</p><p>I was of two minds about prayer&#x2014;correction: I was of more than two minds. I had a whole crowd inside my skull, all jabbering away and no one listening.</p><p><i>Do I have to kneel? Why can&#x2019;t I pray just as well in the shower? Is there anyone to pray to other than the anachronistic God of oily televangelists and creeps? (Here&#x2019;s the church, here&#x2019;s the steeple, open the door, and cheat all the people... ) Praying on my knees is humiliating, especially when I&#x2019;m kneeling on a carpet that was probably made by Nepalese teenagers, working their tiny fingers to the bone without even a boom box to make the weary hours fly. What am I supposed to do with my hands? Really, I should get off the floor and make supper or something...</i></p><p>This is an example of what the Buddha called &#x201c;the monkey mind&#x201d;: the running stream-of-consciousness commentary that is the opposite of the clear, calm, contemplative mindfulness a person is supposed to have when she is praying. Right?</p><p>I always thought so. And because my mind was never empty, never clear, <i>jibber jabber jibber jabber</i>, I couldn&#x2019;t conjure even a moment&#x2019;s meditative mood, which made me feel inadequate and therefore huffy. Untangling myself from the lotus position after trying to meditate, or hoisting myself from the pew after trying to pray, I would self-righteously declare that it was more important to <i>do</i> something useful for the Poor and Downtrodden than to sit around praying.</p><p>In short, mindfulness with its moments of attention (let alone a magnificent gesture) turned out to be a tall order for my mind, which was well stuffed with both the concerns of new motherhood and the details of everyday life. There were immunization appointments, the Iran-Contra fiasco, grocery lists, Penelope Leach vs. Dr. Spock, the oil bill, a freelance editing job, my husband&#x2019;s state police uniforms to pick up at the dry cleaner, and a child&#x2019;s persistent need for a fresh diaper.</p><p>Prayer was already present and available to me in more ways than I realized. Saying grace before a meal or a prayer at bedtime was familiar to me from visits to friends&#x2019; houses and from books and other media, even if my family didn&#x2019;t engage in it.

This time they accompany their scientist parents to Peru. By interpreting patterns woven into an Inca shawl, the youngsters follow clues to the Lost City of Quwi, whose location has eluded explorers for centuries. While the story defies logic and teaches little about local culture, it might serve as an introduction to classroom activities on sequence and pattern perception. Langdo's cartoonlike illustrations adequately depict patterns to decipher but do little to enliven the narrative. In fact, Matt, Bibi, and their canine companion seem oddly static even in dangerous situations. A list of suggested activities follows the story's conclusion.

This new biography will show many images for the first time ever, amongst 300 plates of richness and variety, all of which are originated faithfully from the original artwork.<p></p><p></p> Louis Wain who was born in 1860, was a shy and eccentric personality who became famous by the age of 40 and at his most productive, painted 600 cat pictures a year, and published his celebrated Louis Wain Annuals between 1901 and 1914. His financial difficulties, post war, contributed to a rapid decline into schizophrenia as Wain became isolated and unmanageable. In 1924 he was certified insane and admitted to Springfield hospital. Briefly forgotten he was discovered in this pauper&#x2019;s asylum a year later and following an appeal involving many writers and artists, and the intervention of the Prime Minister himself, he was transferred to the new Napsbury hospital, in the Hertfordshire countryside. In these pleasant surroundings he lived on until 1935, painting ceaselessly and recreating a new and more colorful cat world.<p></p> His later unpublished work is now well known to us as it reveals his schizophrenic illness: highly coloured cats become more frenzied and the pictures are often crammed with paranoid delusional writing: cats are angry and more frenetic and often in the background are the curious buildings of the mental asylums. But at times these pictures reveal a beautiful tranquility with animals living in harmony in bright utopian landscapes.<p></p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Chris Beetles has been the main popularizer of Wain&#x2019;s art and has staged yearly exhibitions since 1983. He is now recognized as the world&#x2019;s leading authority on Louis Wain and is regularly approached by museums, auctions and collectors worldwide to adjudicate on the vast number of forgeries coming onto the market; an inevitable consequence of increasing value on the market. A chapter on Wain forgeries will be written. Chris Beetles is an ex-practicing general practitioner specializing in the diseases of the elderly so he is also uniquely qualified to write the special addendum on art and mental illness. A full book list of Wain&#x2019;s published work completes this valuable and indispensible work which will appeal to both specialist collector and cat enthusiast alike.<p></p></p><h2>The Fame Thief (A Junior Bender Mystery)</h2><p><b>THE LAUGH-OUT-LOUD FUNNY THIRD INSTALLMENT IN THE MYSTERY SERIES FEATURING JUNIOR BENDER, HOLLYWOOD BURGLAR TURNED PRIVATE EYE<br></b><br>There are not many people brave enough to say no to Irwin Dressler, Hollywood&#x2019;s scariest mob boss-turned-movie king.

Dressler wants Junior to solve a &#x201c;crime&#x201d; he believes was committed more than sixty years ago, when an old friend of his, once-famous starlet Dolores La Marr, had her career destroyed after compromising photos were taken of her at a Las Vegas party.

He was,<br>after all, the Dark Lord in the flesh. But now I&#x2019;d survived him<br>once, so I said, &#x201c;Well, Mr. Dressler&#x2014;&#x201c;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A row of yellow teeth, bared in what was supposed to be<br>a smile but looked like the last thing many small animals see.<br>&#x201c;Call me Irwin.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, Mr. Dressler, at the risk of being rowed into the center<br>of the Hollywood Reservoir wired to half a dozen cinder blocks<br>and being offered the chance to swim home, what have I done<br>to disappoint you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nothing. That&#x2019;s the problem.&#x201d; Despite the golf slacks and<br>the polo shirt, Dressler was old without being grandfatherly, old<br>without going all dumpling, old without getting quaint. He&#x2019;d<br>been a dangerous young man in 1943, when he assumed control<br>of mob activity in Los Angeles, and he&#x2019;d gone on being dangerous<br>until he was a dangerous old man. Forty minutes ago, I&#x2019;d<br>been snatched off a Hollywood sidewalk by two walking biceps<br>and thrown into the back seat of a big old Lincoln Town Car,<br>and when I&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your weapon?&#x201d; the guy in the front<br>said, &#x201c;Irwin Dressler,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;d shut up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressler gave me a glance I could have searched for hours<br>without finding any friendliness in it. &#x201c;You got yourself a <i>franchise</i>,<br>Junior, a <i>monopoly</i>, and you&#x2019;re not working it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;My business plan calls for long periods of inactivity.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how this country was built, Junior.&#x201d; Like many<br>great crooks, even the very few at his stratospheric level, Dressler<br>was a political conservative. &#x201c;What made America great? I&#x2019;ll tell<br>you: backbone, elbow grease, noses to the grindstone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds uncomfortable.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressler had lowered his head while he was speaking, perhaps<br>to demonstrate the approved nose-to-the-grindstone position.<br>Only his eyes moved. Beneath heavy white eyebrows, they<br>came up to meet mine, as smooth, dry, and friendly as a couple<br>of river stones. He kept them on me until the back of my neck<br>began to prickle and I shifted in my chair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is amusing?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m amusing you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d; I picked up the platter of bread and brie and said, <br>&#x201c;Cheese?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In my own house he&#x2019;s offering me cheese.&#x201d; Dressler<br>addressed this line to some household spirit hovering invisibly<br>over the table. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true, it&#x2019;s true. I&#x2019;ve grown old.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s, uh, it&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;The loss of American verbal skills,&#x201d; he said, nodding, &#x201c;is<br>a terrible thing. Even in someone like you. I remember a time,<br>this will be hard for you to believe, when almost everyone could<br>speak in complete sentences. In English, no less. What have I<br>done, Junior, that you should laugh at me? Get so old that I<br>don&#x2019;t frighten you any more?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;I bring you here, I give you cheese, good cheese&#x2014;is the<br>cheese good, Junior?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Fabulous,&#x201d; I said, seriously rattled. This had the earmarks<br>of one of Irwin&#x2019;s legendary rants, rants that frequently ended<br>with one less person alive in the room.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Fabulous, he says, it&#x2019;s fabulous. What are you, a hat maker?<br>Of course, it&#x2019;s fabulous. The Jews, you know, we&#x2019;re a desert<br>people. The two gods everybody&#x2019;s killing each other over now,<br>Jehovah and the other one, Allah, they&#x2019;re both desert gods, did<br>you know that, Junior?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Um, yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Desert gods are short on forgiveness, you know? And we Jews,<br>we&#x2019;re the chosen people of a desert god and hospitality is part of<br>our tradition, and now I&#x2019;m going to get badmouthed for my cheese<br>by some <i>pisher</i>, some <i>vonce&#x2014;</i>you know what a <i>vonce </i>is, Junior?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bedbug, in Yiddish, great language for invective. I&#x2019;ll<br>tell you, Junior, I could flay the skin off you using Yiddish alone,<br>I wouldn&#x2019;t even need Babe and Tuffy in the next room there,<br>listening to everything we&#x2019;re saying so they can come in and kill<br>you if I get too excited.

I wasn&#x2019;t thinking.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;But <i>thinking</i>, Junior, that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re supposed to be<br>good at.&#x201d; He reached out and took some bread off the platter,<br>which I was apparently still holding, and said, &#x201c;Down, put it<br>down. Did I offer you wine?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t, but I wasn&#x2019;t about to bring it up. I put<br>the tray in front of him on the table. Inched it toward him so he<br>wouldn&#x2019;t have to lean forward.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;I still got arms,&#x201d; he said, tearing some bread. &#x201c;What were<br>we talking about before you got so upset?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;My franchise.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Right, right. You may not know this, Junior, but you&#x2019;re the<br>only one there is. You&#x2019;re like Lew Winterman when he&#x2014;did you<br>know Lew?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Not personally.&#x201d; Lew Winterman had been the head of<br>Universe Pictures and long considered the most powerful man<br>in Hollywood, at least by those who didn&#x2019;t know that the first<br>thing he did every morning and the last thing he did every night<br>was to phone Irwin Dressler.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;When he and I thought of packaging, we had to get horses<br>to carry it to the bank, that&#x2019;s how much the money weighed,&#x201d;<br>Dressler said. &#x201c;You know packaging? <i>You can have Jimmy Stewart</i><br><i>for your movie, but you also gotta take some whozis, I don&#x2019;t</i><br><i>know, John Gavin</i>. <i>And every other actor in your picture and</i><br><i>also the cameraman and the writers, </i>and he represented them<br>all, Lew did. For about a year after we figured it out, he was the<br>only guy in Hollywood who knew how to do it, and he did it ten<br>hours a day, seven days a week. You know how much he made?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir. How much?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask. You can&#x2019;t think that high. So you&#x2019;re like that<br>now, like Lew, but on your own level, and what are you doing?<br>Sitting around on your <i>tuchis</i>, that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re doing. That<br>whole thing you got going? Solving crimes for crooks? And<br>living through it? You got Vinnie DiGaudio out of the picture<br>for me with every cop in L.A. trying to pin him. You helped<br>Trey Annunziato with her dirty movie, although she didn&#x2019;t<br>like it much, the way you did it. When four hundred and<br>eighty flatscreens got bagged out of Arnie Muffins&#x2019; garage in<br>Panorama City, you brought them back, and without a crowd<br>of people getting killed, which is something, the way Arnie is.<br>You&#x2019;re it, Junior, you&#x2019;re the only one. And you&#x2019;re not working<br>it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Every time I do it,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I almost get killed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Ehhh,&#x201d; Dressler said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young man, in the prime of<br>life. What&#x2019;re you, thirty-eight?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Thirty-seven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Prime of life. Got your reflexes, got all your IQ, at least<br>as much as you were born with. You&#x2019;re piddling along with a<br>franchise that, I&#x2019;m telling you, could be worth millions. Where&#x2019;s<br>the wine?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>You&#x2019;ll </i>get it? You think I&#x2019;m going to let you in my cellar?&#x201d;<br>He picked up a silver bell and rang it. A moment later, one of<br>the bruisers who&#x2019;d abducted me and dragged me up here came<br>into the room. He was roughly nine feet tall and his belt had to<br>be five feet long, and none of it was fat.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Dressler?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Tuffy,&#x201d; Dressler said. &#x201c;You I don&#x2019;t want. Where&#x2019;s Juana?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got a headache.&#x201d; Despite being the size of a genie in<br><i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>, Tuffy had the high, hoarse voice<br>of someone who gargled thumbtacks.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;So mix her my special cocktail, half a glass of water, half a<br>teaspoon each of bicarbonate of soda and cream of Tartar. Stir it<br>up real good, till it foams, and take it to her with two aspirins.<br>And get us a bottle of&#x2014;what do you think, Junior? Burgundy<br>or Bordeaux?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Ummm&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, it&#x2019;s not a Bordeaux day. Too drizzly. We need<br>something with some sunshine in it. Tuffy. Get us a nice Hermitage,<br>the 1990. Wide-mouthed goblets so it can breathe fast. Got it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; Tuffy said, &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Dressler.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;And put on an apron.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; Tuffy took an involuntary step toward me, but Dressler<br>raised one parchment-yellow hand and said, &#x201c;He just needs to<br>pick on somebody. Don&#x2019;t take it personal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; Tuffy gave me a little bonus eye-action for a moment but<br>then ducked his head in Dressler&#x2019;s direction and exited stage left.<br>Dressler said, &#x201c;So. People try to kill you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Occupational hazard. I&#x2019;m working for crooks, but I&#x2019;m also<br>catching crooks. If I solve the crime, the perp wants to kill me. If<br>I don&#x2019;t solve it, my client wants to kill me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s really tough any more,&#x201d; Dressler said, shaking his<br>head at the Decline of the West. &#x201c;You know how we took care<br>of the Italians?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I did. &#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Kind of a long way to say <i>no</i>, isn&#x2019;t it? Three syllables instead<br>of one. So, okay, the Italians came out to California first, and<br>when we got here from Chicago it was like Naples, just Guidos<br>everywhere, running all the obvious stuff: girls, betting, alcohol,<br>unions, pawnshops, dope. Well, we were nice Jewish boys who<br>didn&#x2019;t want to make widows and orphans everywhere so you<br>know what we used? Never mind answering, we used baseball<br>bats. Didn&#x2019;t kill anybody except a few who were extra-stubborn,<br>but we wrapped things up pretty quick. See, <i>that&#x2019;s </i>tough, walking<br>into a room full of guns with a baseball bat. Ask a guy to do<br>that these days, he&#x2019;d have to be wearing Depends.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; Dressler nodded a couple of times, in total agreement with<br>himself. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s say the people who want to kill you, give them<br>the benefit of the doubt, let&#x2019;s say they could manage it. And all that<br>nonsense with a different motel every month isn&#x2019;t really going to<br>cut it, is it? What&#x2019;s the motel this month? Valentine something?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Valentine Shmalentine,&#x201d; I said, feeling like I was drowning.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;In Canoga Park.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Valentine Shmalentine? Kind of name is that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Supposed to be the world&#x2019;s only kosher love motel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s kosher mean for a love motel? No missionary position?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Heh heh heh,&#x201d; I said. He wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know about<br>the motel of the month. <i>Nobody </i>was, beyond my immediate<br>circle: my girlfriend, Ronnie; my daughter, Rina; and a couple<br>of close friends and accomplices, such as Louie the Lost. But, I<br>comforted myself, even if word about the motels had leaked, I<br>still had the ultra-secret apartment in Koreatown. Nobody in<br>the world knew about that except for Winnie Park, the Korean<br>con woman who had sublet it to me, and Winnie was in jail in<br>Singapore and had been for seven years.<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;So the motels don&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; Dressler said, &#x201c;not even taking<br>the room next door like you do, with the connecting door and<br>all, to give you a backup exit. It&#x2019;s a cute trick though, I&#x2019;ll give<br>you that. So I&#x2019;ll tell you what you need. Since you can&#x2019;t hide,<br>I mean. You need a patron, so people know you&#x2019;re under his<br>protection. Somebody who wouldn&#x2019;t kill you even if they caught<br>you playing kneesie with their teenage daughter, and you know<br>how crooks are about their daughters.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;What I need,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;is to quit. Just do the occasional burglary,<br>like a regular crook.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Not an option,&#x201d; Dressler said. &#x201c;You agree that everyone,<br>even a schmuck like Bernie Madoff, has the right to a good<br>defense attorney?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I examined the question and saw the booby trap, but what<br>could I do? &#x201c;I suppose.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Then why don&#x2019;t they deserve a detective when some <i>ganef</i><br>steals something from them? Or tries to frame them, like Vinnie<br>De Gaudio? You remember helping Vinnie Di Gaudio?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure. That was how I met you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;See? You lived through it. You got told to keep Vinnie out<br>of the cops&#x2019; eyes for a murder even though it looked like he<br>did it, and you kept me out of the picture so my little line to<br>Vinnie shouldn&#x2019;t attract attention. This was a job that required<br>tact and finesse, and you showed me both of those things, didn&#x2019;t<br>you? And now you&#x2019;re eating this nice cheese and you&#x2019;re about to<br>drink a wine, a wine that&#x2019;ll put a choir in your ear. So quitting<br>is not an option.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;What <i>is </i>an option?&#x201d; I held up the platter, feeling like I<br>was making an Old-Testament sacrifice. &#x201c;Cheese? It&#x2019;s terrific<br>cheese.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;You can lighten up on the cheese. I know it&#x2019;s good. You<br>thought this dodge up all by yourself, Junior, and I respect that.<br>Something new. Gives me hope for your generation. Like I said,<br>a patron, <i>patronage</i>, that&#x2019;s what you need. And an A-list client,<br>somebody nobody&#x2019;s going to mess with.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;A client and a patron,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Two different people?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s funny,&#x201d; Dressler said gravely. &#x201c;You gotta work with<br>me here, Junior. I&#x2019;ve got your best interests in mind.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t think I don&#x2019;t appreciate it. But I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;I <i>do </i>think you don&#x2019;t appreciate it,&#x201d; Dressler said, &#x201c;and I<br>don&#x2019;t give a shit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;Right.&#x201d;&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;And also, I gotta tell you, this is a job I wouldn&#x2019;t give to just<br>anybody. The client, for example&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;I thought you were the client.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Literal, you&#x2019;re too literal. I&#x2019;m the client in the sense that I&#x2019;m<br>the one who chose you for the job and the one who&#x2019;ll foot the<br>bill. But think about it, Junior. Am I somebody some crook&#x2019;s<br>going to hit?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;How stupid would anybody have to be to hit me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Someone would have to be insane to take your newspaper<br>off your lawn.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Not bad. Sometimes I get glimpses of something that makes<br>me think maybe you&#x2019;re smart after all. No, the client, in the<br>sense that she&#x2019;s the one who got ripped off, the client is&#x2014;are you<br>ready, Junior?&#x201d; He sat back as though to measure my reaction<br>better.<br>&nbsp; I put both hands on the arms of my chair to demonstrate<br>readiness. &#x201c;Ready.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Your client is . . . Dolores La Marr.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; There was a little <i>ta-daaa </i>in his voice and something expectant<br>in his expression, something that tipped me off that this was<br>a test I didn&#x2019;t want to fail. So I said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;Dolores,&#x201d; he said, nodding three times, &#x201c;La Marr.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;Wow. Dolores La Marr.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &#x201c;The most beautiful woman in the world,&#x201d; Dressler said,<br>and there was a hush of reverence in his voice. &#x201c;<i>Life </i>magazine<br>said so. On the cover, no l...</p><h2>One Matchless Time: A Life of William Faulkner</h2><p><p>Jay Parini, the author of highly praised biographies of Robert Frost and John Steinbeck, has now written an engaging biography of one of the most significant American writers of the twentieth century.</p><p><em>One Matchless Time</em> is a sympathetic, sweeping evocation of William Faulkner's life and work. From his birth in 1897 in Mississippi to his death sixty-five years later, Faulkner spent almost his entire life on this one small patch of land, the "significant soil" from which all his fiction grew. Jay Parini paints an intimate picture of Faulkner's Mississippi world and shows how the artist transformed this raw material into Yoknapatawpha County, a place of pure imagination.</p><p>Between 1928 and 1942, during what Faulkner called his "one matchless time," a period of wild inspiration when characters and stories came to him mysteriously and in abundance, he published more than half a dozen masterpieces, including the novels <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>; <em>As I Lay Dying</em>; <em>Sanctuary</em>; <em>Light in August</em>; <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>; <em>The Wild Palms</em>; <em>Go Down, Moses</em>; and <em>The Hamlet</em>. This is an astonishing achievement without equal in American literature.</p><p>Parini, who has taught Faulkner's work to students for nearly thirty years, vividly brings to life this writer's complex fictional world in the context of his life, using the one to illuminate the other. He uses letters and memoirs unavailable to earlier biographers as well as interviews he had with Faulkner's daughter and several of his lovers. His William Faulkner is an immensely gifted, obsessive artist plagued by alcoholism and a bad marriage, but someone who rose above his limitations to become a figure of major importance on the stage of world literature. <em>One Matchless Time</em> is a magnificent biography, profound, thought-provoking, meticulously researched, elegantly composed, and a tribute to the genius of its subject.</p></p><p><p>Michael Hoffman is a filmmaker known for creating complex and layered stories with great attention to detail and character. A skilled writer and director, he has worked on both feature films and documentaries, including <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>The Emperor's Club</em>, <em>Game of Six</em>, and the ESPN documentary Out of the Blue. <em>The Last Station</em> is his most recent film.</p><p>Jay Parini is a professor of English &amp; Creative Writing at Middlebury College in Vermont. A writer and academic, he is best known for his novels and poetry. He is the author of the novel <em>The Last Station</em>, which is now a major motion picture from Sony Classics.</p>Forty-three years after the death of William Faulkner, the amount of scholarship (mostly pedantry) devoted to his work almost literally defies calculation, much less careful absorption by any single reader. As Jay Parini notes toward the end of One Matchless Time, in which he attempts to connect Faulkner the man and Faulkner the writer, Faulkner's work for some time has been read more on campuses than by the general public, with the result -- neither mentioned nor explored by Parini -- that it has been torn to pieces by the academic shredder. Many university careers have been built on the foundation laid by Faulkner, and professors by the scores owe their tenure to him, but astonishingly few books of real merit have emerged from all this scholarly hairsplitting.<p>Take, by way of example, the Faulkner biographies. Two (by Joseph Blotner and Frederick R. Karl) are massive; two (by Stephen B. Oates and Parini) are of standard length; one (by David Minter) is relatively concise. All are the work of academics. Though Minter's and to some extent Parini's can be recommended to the lay reader as useful introductions to the life and work of the 20th century's greatest American writer, none comes even close to being both "definitive" (however one cares to interpret that term) and of a literary quality suitable to its subject. No Lytton Strachey or Leon Edel has stepped forward to give Faulkner his due.</p><p>Whether this really matters much is, at the least, open to argument. Faulkner himself told Malcolm Cowley, rather famously, that it was "my ambition to be, as a private individual, abolished and voided from history, leaving it markless, no refuse save the printed books"; how sincere he was in this is unclear, but he did understand that to readers it is a writer's work, not his life, that matters. Though first Karl and now Parini have struggled mightily to find actual and psychological connections between Faulkner's life and work, most evidence indicates that the two were surprisingly separate and distinct. Understanding Faulkner's work, in other words, doesn't seem to require knowing the details of his life.</p><p>Precisely why Parini has chosen to take a stab at this rather elusive business is something of a mystery. In his very first sentence he informs us: "In the mid-seventies, Robert Penn Warren urged me, on one of our regular hikes through the Vermont woods near Mount Stratton, to 'take on Faulkner.' " Apart from being a deftly executed piece of name-dropping, this isn't very helpful, and Parini's subsequent declaration that this book is "an attempt to reach through Faulkner to find him in his work, the work in him, without reading crassly backward from the work into the life" doesn't add much either, since the same could be said of just about any literary biography.</p><p>Whatever the explanation for One Matchless Time, Parini brings certain strengths to the task -- fairness, balance and sympathy -- and one important weakness: He doesn't know much about the South. Yes, he's read about it, and he's doubtless attended some of those Faulkner "festivals" that the Dixie literati throw at the slightest excuse, but that isn't the same as living it and knowing it. Interestingly, of the five Faulkner biographers, only Minter is a Southerner (Oates is from Texas, which isn't the same), and the lack of true familiarity with the region shows in the work of all four others -- in particular that of Karl, whose hostility to the South is blatant.</p><p>Parini does understand that Faulkner had "divided views about the Old and New Souths" -- as a young man he "sentimentalized relations between blacks and whites," but "the mature Faulkner understood the destructive nature of slavery" -- but the rich, complex, ambiguous nature of the South and its history largely eludes him. By the same token, though he understands that Faulkner's views on race were equally complex and ambiguous, he doesn't really seem to understand what it was like to be a white Southerner of decent instincts but strong fidelity to tradition during the years (1897-1962) of Faulkner's lifetime. Faulkner was deeply, genuinely torn, and the painful twists and turns he underwent were scarcely unique; many others among his contemporaries suffered them, which is to say that in important ways he was representative of rather than an exception to his time, place and class.</p><p>Parini tells Faulkner's story straightforwardly, adding little to the immense body of Faulkneriana that has accumulated since Blotner's doorstopper was published in 1974. He has interviewed Faulkner's daughter, Jill Summers, who conveys her abiding love and respect for her father as well as the grief his drinking inflicted on his family, and a few others (Warren, Gore Vidal, Elaine Steinbeck, Graham Greene, Mario Vargas Llosa) whose connections to Faulkner are slender at best, though some of them have mildly interesting insights or recollections. He is better than most at showing how astonishingly influential Faulkner has been on writers outside the United States, not just in France -- where he was venerated well before most American readers had heard his name -- but in Latin America, where the effect his work had on the likes of Vargas Llosa and Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez was absolutely pivotal.</p><p>Though Parini does tell Faulkner's story in a workmanlike way, there isn't all that much of a story to tell. Apart from his writing -- which in Faulkner's mind seems to have taken place in its own separate universe, a point Parini makes with some care and skill -- he really didn't do much. He spent an appalling amount of time not just under the influence of alcohol but falling-down drunk, booze being for him "a form of self-medication, a way of fending off the pains of his own past as well as the continuing agony of his personal life"; his marriage to the former Estelle Oldham was mostly unhappy, at times dreadfully so, yet each granted the other a perverse loyalty; he fled into affairs with several women, but doesn't seem to have found real happiness with any of them; he puttered around his house and farm outside Oxford, the Mississippi town where he spent almost his entire life; he worried obsessively about money, even after the Nobel Prize of 1949 and its aftermath made him modestly well-to-do.</p><p>As Faulkner seems to have known better than anyone who has studied him, with the possible exceptions of Malcolm Cowley and Cleanth Brooks, the work, not the life, matters. Parini writes perceptively, though not especially originally, about Faulkner's "string of incomparable masterworks between 1928 and 1942 -- 'one matchless time,' as he called it," -- and declines to overrate his lesser work, A Fable in particular. To my taste he underrates Faulkner's later work -- The Town, The Mansion, The Reivers -- which certainly doesn't have the depth and power of The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, As I Lay Dying, et al., but has very real charm and rich humor. But as is generally true of Faulkner's biographers, Parini approaches him and his work with a certain humorlessness, which may explain his response to these books.</p><p>Parini correctly ranks Faulkner alongside Balzac and Dickens. All three created universes of their own, incredibly populous places in which the writers tried, in Faulkner's words, "to put it all, if possible, on one pinhead," and got, each in his own way, very close to just that. Parini also has wise words for the reader:</p><p>"Faulkner cannot be read; he can only be reread. A single book can hardly be consumed in isolation from the other work in a satisfactory way; indeed, the whole of Faulkner moves together, as one tale informs another, as characters evolve in time and place. Particular stories and characters make more sense when the whole of Yoknapatawpha County comes into view, its concentric circles widening out from the courthouse in Jefferson to the plantation houses and cotton fields, the wild country of Frenchman's Bend, populated by Snopeses and Varners, to Beat Four, where the Gowrie clan resides, making whiskey and fighting among themselves." </p><p>To say the same thing another way: Read Faulkner, not about Faulkner.</p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

On the one hand, Europeans believe they have at last created an ideal social and political system in which man can live comfortably. In many ways, things have never been better on the old continent. On the other hand, there is growing anxiety that Europe is quickly falling behind in an aggressive, globalized world. Europe is at the forefront of nothing, its demographics are rapidly transforming in unsettling ways, and the ancient threat of barbarian invasion has resurfaced in a fresh manifestation.<br> <br>In The New Vichy Syndrome, Theodore Dalrymple traces this malaise back to the great conflicts of the last century and their devastating effects upon the European psyche. From issues of religion, class, colonialism, and nationalism, Europeans hold a miserablist&#x201d; view of their history, one that alternates between indifference and outright contempt of the past. Today&#x2019;s Europeans no longer believe in anything but personal economic security, an increased standard of living, shorter working hours, and long vacations in exotic locales.<br> <br>The result, Dalrymple asserts, is an unwillingness to preserve European achievements and the dismantling of western culture by Europeans themselves. As vapid hedonism and aggressive Islamism fill this cultural void, Europeans have no one else to blame for their plight.<br></p><p>Theodore Dalrymple is a former psychiatrist and prison doctor.

In fact, when he hears a dead body has been found on the grounds of Holm Coultram College, he thinks of it as a rather good start. This is 1971, and the police force does not enjoy the warmest of relations with the Ivory Tower. Nevertheless, Dalziel takes himself to college, where the single corpse is followed by another and then another, until even Dalziel is forced to admit that someone is going after the academic community with rather excessive zeal. As the investigation grows more complex, help arrives from some unexpected corners, Dalziel's callow young sergeant proves surprisingly insightful, and everyone involved gets some useful education.

The first Seuss title to feature full-color art on every other page, this adventurous picture book tells of Marco-who first imagined an extraordinary parade in <i>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</i>-as he daydreams of all the possibilities that await him while he fishes in McElligot's Pool. Optimistic and exciting, this tale is the perfect bait, and readers young and old will be hooked on this fish-tastic favorite.</p><p><i>McElligot's Pool</i> is a Seuss classic from the distant era before even <i>The Cat In The Hat</i>. It's a single poetic variation on the theme of adult skepticism that's no match for childhood faith and daydreaming. A small boy is fishing in the tiny, unpromising McElligot's Pool, a puddle that (as a passing farmer informs our diminutive hero) is nothing but a hole where people dispose of their junk. But the boy is all optimism: what if the pool is deeper than anyone thinks? What if it connects to an underground stream that flows under the town to the sea? Might not all sorts of fish then swim up the stream and be caught here? "I might catch an eel... (Well, I might. It depends.) A long twisting eel with a lot of strange bends. And, oddly enough, with a head at both ends!" The moral of the story is straightforward: "If I wait long enough, if I'm patient and cool,/ Who knows what I'll catch in McElligot's pool?"

Using unforgettable accounts of both famous and little-known Americans, Under God examines the stories of men and women who forged our nation. Against these, they pair the dark side of America&#39;s legacy--racism, slavery, injustice--in order that a new generation might seek God&#39;s face and avoid repeating sins of the past. The authors draw on the resources of WallBuilders, a national organization that distributes historical, legal, and statistical information and helps citizens become active in their communities.</p><p>THE SHINING LIGHT OF LIBERTY AND THE SHADOWS OF THE DREAM On July 4, 1776, the forefathers of our nation set upon a course and forged a direction that would reverberate throughout the world and lead this nation to offer unforeseen levels of hope, prosperity, and freedom to an amazing tapestry of people. The American Revolution was truly revolutionary. <p> "Government of the people, by the people, for the people" was a very radical concept. No one could have dreamed the impact it would have. In our founding document, the Declaration of Independence, one of the most profound ideals set forth was that "all men are created equal." Today, it is hard to truly understand how radical the introduction of that concept was. It helps to go back to the eighteenth century and gain a greater understanding of what the world was like. Kings and queens were the rulers and conquerors of the day. Justice and wealth was held in their hands. Our forefathers sought to take some of that tightly bound power and distribute it so that many who could never dream of hope and opportunity would find peace and prosperity through a freedom that was built upon the principles of God. In 1776, and for basically the next two hundred years, however, for some who lived in America, this concept of "all men are created equal" was more authentic in word than it was i! n deed. </p><p> Two enormous tragedies that occurred through Europe&#x2019;s colonization of America are found in the stories of Native Americans (or the Host Peoples) and the descendants of Africa. Slavery, the great scourge of our national history, became a gaping wound of injustice from the very outset of our nation&#x2019;s birth. As well, as white settlers moved west in search of a better life, the Native American peopleswere decimated and expelled from their lands. It is important to grasp that these two people groups&#x2014;Native Americans and blacks&#x2014;did not come to America seeking the American Dream. It is probably more accurate to say that they lived the American nightmare. What is often lost in all this, however, are the amazing contributions made to this great country. Every step of the way as our nation developed, they were right there making major contributions. </p><p> While our forefathers set forth the ideal of what this nation could become, it was immensely more difficult to carry out and ensure this ideal for all men and women. It is a profound task that continues to this very day. Here is where we see the greatness of the American Revolution: A foundation was laid that would allow for change, and this foundation could be built upon to lift this nation higher toward its grand ideal. Our forefathers cautioned, however, that if we were to lose our religion and morality, our foundation would surely crumble. </p><p> This is a glimpse into the battle that started roughly five hundred years ago when the first European explorers came to this land. Some have called it our "dual heritage." To help give a framework for examining this heritage, we can look at two of the earliest settlements&#x2014;Jamestown and Plymouth. Jamestown, Virginia, was a colony primarily formed as a business venture by investors to obtain wealth. In contrast, Plymouth, Massachussettes, was a colony established by Pilgrims primarily to further the Gospel. The Protestant Reformation was a powerful force that fueled the vision of the Pilgrims.</p><p> If you study these two settlements in any kind of depth, you will find some interesting observations. Plymouth centered around covenanting with God and with one another. While they were not perfect, by any means, over and over the Pilgrims seemed to encounter divine providence at just the right times. Jamestown, on the other hand, centered primarily on the acquisition of gold and the building of capital. While there were some redemptive elements in the colony, the settlers seemed to encounter much fighting and bickering and failure.</p><p> Many people came to America. Many came seeking wealth. Many came seeking religious freedom. </p><p> When studying the founding of the United States, one thing that you can&#x2019;t help but encounter is the faith of our forefathers. Time and time again our forefathers recognized God&#x2019;s hand in the shaping of this nation. You will find Him mentioned repeatedly in their words and documents. Amazingly, hardly any of this factual history is taught today, whereas it was common public school teaching material seventy-five years ago. It is important to note, though, that while our forefathers were great men who did great things, they were also just men. Fallible. Imperfect. </p><p> When we decided to embark upon creating this book, we decided to use King David from the Bible as our model. He was a man after God&#x2019;s own heart, but he was also a murderer and adulterer. And though David repented of his errors, they haunted him the rest of his life. In the same way, our forefathers left some things undone, and along the way our nation plunged into some dark traditions.</p><p> Ours is a heritage of light and ours is a heritage of darkness.</p><p> This book is a collection of short stories about our heritage. Each short story could have&#x2014;and has had&#x2014;entire books written about its subject. Our collection of stories is by no means exhaustive. We have left out many great ones. But it is our hope that these accounts will ignite a passion and inspire you to learn more about the great heritage you have and to seek out the unfinished work left to do. It is our hope that you enjoy reading these stories as much as we did discovering them. TOBY and MICHAEL</p><b>What does it mean to be a nation "Under God"?

Now, Vidal has written his most devastating exploration of Imperial America to date. "Not since the 1846 attack on Mexico in order to seize California" Vidal writes, "has an American government been so nakedly predatory." Bush's apparent invincibility, and what he might or might not know&#x2014;especially about those new "black box" voting machines being installed all over the country&#x2014;is one of the central themes of "State of the Union 2004," a magnificent and witty Olympian survey of American Empire, where the war on terror is judged as nonsensical as the "war on dandruff," where America is an "Enron-Pentagon prison," a land of ballooning budget deficits thanks to the growth of a garrison state, tax cuts for the privileged, and the creeping totalitarianism of the Ashcroft justice department. Collected in this volume are Vidal's earlier State of the Union addresses, a tradition inaugurated on the David Susskind show in the early seventies as a counterpoint to "whoever happened to be president."</p><p>The commercial success of <i>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace</i> and <i>Dreaming War </i>shows that Vidal's Jeffersonian anti-imperialism is fashionable again with the left wing of the book-buying public. In time for the election season, Vidal has dashed off three rambling anti-Bush diatribes and collected eight articles from the <i>Nation</i>, <i>Esquire</i> and other magazines, written from 1975 to 2004. Many of the selections take the form of mock State of the Union addresses, and while Vidal's consistency over the years is admirable, reading 11 variants of the same stump speech becomes monotonous. Vidal typically includes denunciations of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Truman for their part in constructing America's "National Security State." He believes that the Cold Warriors invented a phony Communist bogeyman and that "Israeli fifth columnists" such as Norman Podhoretz control America's policy in the Middle East. Vidal would end the war on drugs and nationalize health care and natural resources. And he would change the Constitution to make America a parliamentary democracy and break the monopoly of what he calls the "Property party," with "its two wings: Republican and Democrat." Vidal is at his most convincing and entertaining when he's jeering at democratic pieties about America, which he believes is actually an oligarchy run by a military-industrial-financial elite that he calls "the bank." Vidal may be in tune with the zeitgeist again because his polemical writing resembles the new blogger punditry: conversational, tart, fervent, digressive, susceptible to idiosyncratic theories but capable of worthwhile provocations. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Like <i>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace</i> (2002) and <i>Dreaming War</i> (2003), this final volume in Vidal's trilogy attacking the "Cheney-Bush junta" contains some new analysis padded out by previously published essays (most of these are from the 1980s). This time, Vidal tackles the American imperial impulse, placing the Cheney-Bush wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the context of America's 1846 seizure of California and the later annexation of colonies in the Pacific. Vidal's vast knowledge of American history and his blazing wit set him apart from the other Bush bashers, and even his old stuff will be fun to read for those sharing his point of view. Some of the material is dated, though, such as an analysis from 1985 of Reagan's Christian apocalypticism, which never really gets connected to imperial America or its current leaders. And the book's organization leaves something to be desired; some observations are repeated almost verbatim 100 pages apart. Still, Vidal's fierce, vitriolic voice remains relevant. The highlight of the book is the opening essay, a scathing critique of what Vidal calls Cheney-Bush's "hijacking" of the election and their subsequent administration, and so it's a bit disappointing that most of the material here is older. Vidal's historical analysis is often fascinating, but fellow Bush-bashers will wish for more current intelligence. <i>John Green</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

O'Rourke's rants on everything from parenting to technology to politics. Nothing is safe from O'Rourke's ridicule, and from his vantage point on the conservative couch, he manages to press every liberal button over and over again. Hill reads these essays with gusto, seeming to relish each subject and the casual format. He also seems to suffer O'Rourke's egocentrism and know-it-all attitude, bringing a much needed grounding voice to the essays. Hill makes O'Rourke's sometimes funny, sometimes irritating opinions and observations easy-to-swallow food for thought, no small task considering O'Rourke's extremist views.

There he attended high school at the Gabrieli-Gymnasium and graduated in 2005. He first discovered a passion for cooking as a young child in his parents kitchen, where he learned the basics of various culinary cultures from two adept amateur chefs.<br> Besides cooking, his second greatest passion is surfing. Since his early youth he has spent every available week traveling to various surf spots around the world. After graduating from high school, he studied at the Akademie U5 school of graphic and communication design in Munich and completed his degree in the summer of 2008. He then set off on a world tour equipped with surfboard, backpack, and cooking knives. After seven inspirational months in Canada, the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, he returned to Germany in March 2009. In June 2009 he began an internship in graphic design at the renowned Matt/Alster advertising agency, where he eventually reached the level of Senior Art Director. While at Jung von Matt, he received numerous national and international creativity awards and developed ad campaigns for brands such as Mercedes Benz, MTV, and Ricola. After four and a half years, he left Jung von Matt to work on the travel, cooking, and surfing project "Salt &amp; Silver" together with photographer-cameraman Thomas Kosikowski.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Thomas Kosikowski</b><br> Thomas Kosikowski was born in 1988.

A former consultant in the California State Legislature, she lives in Northern California with her husband Dan and their five children.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two months of planning, two days for the execution, Operation Heatwave had commenced.</p> <p>More than 150 police officers and federal agents from every major law enforcement organization coordinated to serve active warrants on violent criminals in the largest sweep to date in San Antonio, Texas. Newly minted FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid was thrilled to have been chosen to participate in the action, though it wasn&#x2019;t a surprise&#x2014;half the Violent Crimes Squad had been tagged. The sweep landed on her three-month anniversary as a sworn FBI agent; ever since her arrival in San Antonio ten weeks ago, she&#x2019;d been working on this operation.</p> <p>They were starting at five o&#x2019;clock Saturday morning and would be working for sixteen hours straight, then start again at five a.m. Sunday. A separate processing center had been set up for those arrested in the sweep. The task force had processed over seven thousand active state and federal warrants to narrow and prioritize cases to those where they had verified intelligence on fugitives&#x2019; whereabouts, focusing on the most dangerous predators.</p> <p>Lucy had been briefed and trained, but the execution was far bigger and more intense than she imagined. She and her team would serve the warrant, search the property, arrest the fugitives, and then turn them over to a patrol unit for processing while the team moved to the next target.</p> <p>DEA Supervisory Agent Brad Donnelly headed Lucy&#x2019;s group of ten cops&#x2014;eight on the ground and two in the tactical van. Quiroz from her unit was the only other FBI agent. The van was manned by two Bexar County Sheriff&#x2019;s deputies.</p> <p>Working with so many different levels of law enforcement had been overwhelming at first, but she loved that she could jump in with both feet and learn as she worked. She realized quickly that she didn&#x2019;t love being stuck in her cubicle at headquarters. Ryan Quiroz was a great partner to learn from&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been a cop in Houston prior to joining the FBI and seemed to know almost everyone they encountered. He reminded Lucy of her brother Connor&#x2014;a bit hotheaded and arrogant, but as sharp as they came. And there was the added benefit that everyone liked him, so his goodwill rubbed off on her.</p> <p>The first house they targeted Saturday morning was textbook. The low-level drug dealer gave up without fanfare. At the second house, the suspect wasn&#x2019;t home. They did a routine search, but the girlfriend (ex-girlfriend according to her) told them she&#x2019;d kicked him to the curb the week before for stealing from her.</p> <p>At a staging area near the third target house, Team Leader Brad Donnelly gave a brief rundown of the situation, though they&#x2019;d been given a file the night before on the targets.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know who we&#x2019;re looking for&#x2014;George and Jaime Sanchez. Brothers, twenty-nine and twenty-six, respectively. You have their photos; know them. They are considered armed and dangerous.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Sanchez brothers had missed their court date on an attempted murder charge. That they&#x2019;d been out on bail in the first place had been a stunner to the prosecution, who thought they&#x2019;d had a high enough bail to prevent their release. But the money was there, and now they weren&#x2019;t.</p> <p>&#x201c;We have information that they&#x2018;re staying with their sister, Mirabelle Sanchez Borez. She has a rap sheet but no active warrants. She&#x2019;s hostile, but we&#x2019;re hoping she won&#x2019;t cause a fuss&#x2014;she has two young girls and seems to have kept her nose clean for the last few years. Her crime, if any, is harboring her fugitive brothers. We have a warrant to search her house.&#x201d;</p> <p>San Antonio Police Officer Crane scowled. &#x201c;Bastards got Easy Axe. Should never have been let out of a cage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Easy Axe?&#x201d; Lucy asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Judge Eleanor Axelrod,&#x201d; Crane said with a snort. He was about to continue, but Donnelly cut him off.</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a gang-related battle, not directly Texas Mexican Mafia, but the Sanchezes may have gone over or have an allegiance agreement. The younger brother has extensive ties to the drug cartels in Mexico, and we believe that he&#x2019;s the one who took the hit on one of the TMM&#x2019;s rivals. It&#x2019;s going to continue to escalate if we don&#x2019;t shut this down.&#x201d;</p> <p>Donnelly looked at Lucy. &#x201c;Kincaid, you&#x2019;re with me this time, you and French. If the girls are in the house, and we believe they are, they may only speak Spanish. They&#x2019;ll be more comfortable with a female Spanish-speaking cop.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Quiroz, you&#x2019;re with Crane and Everston in the back. Rollins and Butcher, back me up. If sister answers the door, I&#x2019;ll be sending her to you to secure. Our intelligence says that there are only those five people inside, three adults and two children. However, the brothers are prone to bringing home women, so there may be others&#x2014;hostile or a package, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p> <p>That was a new one for Lucy&#x2014;Donnelly was the only person she&#x2019;d met who&#x2019;d called hostages &#x201c;packages.&#x201d; But she wasn&#x2019;t surprised&#x2014;every unit seemed to have a different term for suspects and for innocents.</p> <p>&#x201c;Questions?&#x201d; Donnelly asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Age of the minors?&#x201d; Quiroz asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Seven and eleven.&#x201d;</p> <p>Crane said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s rock-and-roll.&#x201d;</p> <p>They were in full protective gear, except for helmets. As soon as they left the tactical truck they fanned out to their assigned posts. Donnelly rapped loudly on the door. &#x201c;Federal agents, we have a warrant. Open the door.&#x201d;</p> <p>There was movement inside, and Lucy saw a pair of large, round brown eyes looking at her through the blinds. She motioned to Donnelly, and he nodded that he&#x2019;d seen the child.</p> <p>Donnelly repeated the command in Spanish and Lucy winced. His Spanish was rough and threatening. She took the liberty of talking to the girl directly.</p> <p>&#x201c;My name is Lucy, and it would help if you could open the door, please,&#x201d; she said in Spanish. &#x201c;Your mommy isn&#x2019;t in any trouble. But we need to come in.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was clear Donnelly didn&#x2019;t understand exactly what she said, but the girl did, and she dropped the blinds. She undid the chain before a loud female voice shouted in Spanish, &#x201c;Bella! Get away from the door!&#x201d; Then she shouted at Donnelly in English, &#x201c;Go away, you got nothing on me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ms. Borez, we have a warrant for the arrest of George Sanchez and Jaime Sanchez. We know they&#x2019;re inside.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We need to come in and look for ourselves.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to let you in. I know my rights.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We have a search warrant, Ms. Borez. Make this easy on yourself and your kids.&#x201d;</p> <p>In her earpiece Lucy heard Crane say, &#x201c;One of the suspects is climbing out the bathroom window.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Rollins, you and Butch take him,&#x201d; Donnelly said into his mike. He nodded to Lucy and French. &#x201c;Cover me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gun drawn, Donnelly tried the door. It wasn&#x2019;t locked thanks to the little girl, and he pushed it in.</p> <p>&#x201c;Down, down, down!&#x201d; he shouted.</p> <p>The two girls looked terrified, particularly the younger child. &#x201c;Get them out, Kincaid!&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy spoke quickly in Spanish, telling the girls to come with her. Fortunately, they did, and Lucy took them immediately to the tactical truck. She had them behind the truck, to protect them from any potential gunfire.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to hurt my mommy, are you?&#x201d; the younger girl asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Lucy hoped Mirabelle didn&#x2019;t do anything stupid. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Bella, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Isabella. My mommy calls me Bella. And my friends. My teachers call me Isabella.&#x201d; She wrinkled her nose.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a pretty name. I&#x2019;m Lucy. It&#x2019;s short for Lucia.&#x201d; Lucy looked at the older girl. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p> <p>The eleven-year-old glared at her. She was scared and angry, but mostly distrustful. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not telling you anything.&#x201d; It pained Lucy that so many parents, particularly those on the wrong side of the law, taught their children to hate and doubt law enforcement.</p> <p>Bella said, &#x201c;Are you here because of the boy?&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy&#x2019;s radar went up. &#x201c;What boy?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The boy in the basement. Michael.&#x201d;</p> <p>The older sister hit Bella across the face, and the girl cried out.</p> <p>Lucy said with thinly restrained anger, &#x201c;Do not touch her again.&#x201d; Into her mike she added, &#x201c;I need an officer.&#x201d;</p> <p>One of the sheriff&#x2019;s deputies in the tactical van came around back. Lucy stepped aside with Deputy Lawrence while keeping her eyes on the girls. &#x201c;I need to talk to the younger girl away from her sister. Keep a close eye, though. She&#x2019;s not cooperative.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy pulled Bella aside even though her sister was shouting at them.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be in <i>big</i> trouble, Isabella!&#x201d; the older girl called after them. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say anything to no cop, I swear, I&#x2019;ll make you pay.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your sister&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; Lucy asked.</p> <p>Through tears, Bella said, &#x201c;CeCe. It&#x2019;s short for Priscilla, but she hates that name.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Michael?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I c-c-can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She shook her head.</p> <p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let CeCe or anyone hurt you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bella looked at Lucy with big, frightened eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying.&#x201d;</p> <p>What had happened to this little girl?</p> <p>Lucy tried, but Bella wasn&#x2019;t talking, her scared eyes on the house. Lucy listened to her team with one ear. They had George Sanchez in custody, but not Jaime. They were still searching the house, but believed Jaime had left before their own arrival. Mirabelle&#x2019;s car was missing, and it had been there the night before during a surveillance check.</p> <p>Lucy said into her mike, &#x201c;Donnelly, there may be someone in the basement. A minor.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t need to warn him that Jaime could be hiding there as well.</p> <p>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;</p> <p>To Bella, she said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d; But that felt like a lie. Here were two minor girls, one who had attitude about authority most likely learned from her family. Their mother was in custody for harboring a fugitive and resisting, and their uncle was in custody for attempted murder and jumping bail. The mother might be released, but what did that mean for Bella and CeCe? Either they would be back home and involved in their mother&#x2019;s sketchy lifestyle, or they would be subjected to foster care.</p> <p>Neither option was ideal. Lucy would much prefer them to be with family, but what kind of life was this for children?</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you know when your uncle Jaime left?&#x201d;</p> <p>She shrugged. &#x201c;I was supposed to be sleeping. But they were arguing and woke me up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you have a clock in your room?&#x201d;</p> <p>She shook her head. &#x201c;It was still dark. But I didn&#x2019;t go back to sleep, and it got light real quick.&#x201d;</p> <p>Probably between four and six in the morning.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you know what they were talking about?&#x201d;</p> <p>She shook her head, keeping her eyes averted. &#x201c;I put a pillow over my head. But Uncle Jaime was very upset. Mama was worried. Then I heard the car. That&#x2019;s our only car.&#x201d;</p> <p>In her ear she heard Donnelly say, &#x201c;Cellar is clear. But someone was living down here. Kincaid, I need you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two minutes, sir,&#x201d; she said. She motioned for the two officers who were standing next to the patrol car. &#x201c;I need one of you to stay with Bella.&#x201d; She glanced at CeCe. &#x201c;And keep her and her sister apart.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;</p> <p>One of the officers squatted down so he was eye level with Bella. &#x201c;My name is Officer Jim Wyatt. Do you want to see the inside of my patrol car?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Am I going to jail?&#x201d; Bella spoke English well enough, Lucy realized. She probably understood even more.</p> <p>&#x201c;No. You can sit in the front seat, okay? We have a computer and a bunch of neat stuff. Some stickers, I think. And my wife made me cookies. Chocolate chip. They&#x2019;re really good.&#x201d;</p> <p>She gave him a tentative smile and took his hand.</p> <p>Lucy nodded her appreciation to Wyatt and hightailed it back to the Sanchez house. George Sanchez was cuffed and sitting on the ground with one officer covering him. Nicole Rollins had custody of Mirabelle Borez. Mirabelle stared at Lucy. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t talk to my kids! I know my rights, you can&#x2019;t talk to them without me! They&#x2019;re just babies, you have no right, <i>puta.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; Nicole told her. She rolled her eyes at Lucy.</p> <p>Lucy ignored Mirabelle and caught up with Donnelly, who took her down the long narrow driveway to the detached single-car garage. A door flush with the ground led to a basement under the garage; stairs led down to a dimly lit and musty room.</p> <p>Donnelly said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve called in a team of dogs. They&#x2019;ll be here in less than an hour. I have a feeling, in my gut, there&#x2019;s something here, but instead of ripping the place apart I&#x2019;ll let the dogs sniff it out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bella, the younger girl, thought we were here because of the boy in the basement. She called him Michael.&#x201d;</p> <p>He motioned to the opened door. &#x201c;This was locked from the outside. And it&#x2019;s clear someone was living down there. It&#x2019;s not pretty.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy was used to <i>not pretty</i>. She went down the stairs.</p> <p>The smell hit her first, before she was halfway down the rotting staircase. Human waste. A bare lightbulb hung from the ceiling on a wire; it cast the only light in the room, except for Ryan Quinoz&#x2019;s flashlight. There was a plastic bucket in the corner that had been used as a toilet, and it hadn&#x2019;t been recently cleaned. Flies moved freely around it. Four cots on rusting metal frames took up half the room. Three had no blankets; one had a solitary sheet and an old, torn sleeping bag with a broken zipper. A shelf had remnants of food&#x2014;crackers mostly. A few bottles of water remained; several more were empty and had been tossed under the cots. Restraints were chained to the beds.</p> <p>&#x201c;My first thought was a sanctuary for illegals coming up from the border,&#x201d; Donnelly said. &#x201c;But the external lock makes it unlikely.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Unless they were kept down here for involuntary servitude.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ryan spoke up. &#x201c;I busted a place like that when I was a cop in Houston. Sweatshop. Much bigger-scale than this. Illegal immigrants were kept in a storage room under the factory. Eight hours sleep, sixteen hours work. Our numbers guys cracked the books. The average illegal worker would have had to work nine years, six months to pay off the so-called debt. This&#x201d;&#x2014;he waved his hand&#x2014;&#x201c;this doesn&#x2019;t make sense.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy slipped on plastic gloves and searched the small confines. There was a dirty plate under one cot. A shoe box of cookies, homemade. Both hidden in the far corner, where two cots met, hard to see unless you were looking for them. She also found three paperbacks, in English. She frowned, flipping through the pages. The books were stamped SAN ANTONIO PUBLIC LIBRARY. Mirabelle spoke English, and the girls seemed to understand and speak well enough, though they were more comfortable with Spanish. These were action-adventure books, not really the type two young girls would read.</p> <p>Lucy hadn&#x2019;t seen a room like the basement before, but she knew all too well what this place had been used for. Prison.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to bring Bella down here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She thought she was in trouble because of the boy in the basement. Her uncle was worried and angry, and the adults were arguing before Jaime left in Mirabelle&#x2019;s car. What if it wasn&#x2019;t because they got wind of Operation Heatwave, but because of this Michael?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is out of bounds of our warrant,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;If Michael is a minor child in danger, we have an obligation to pursue this.&#x201d;</p> <p>Donnelly didn&#x2019;t seem like he wanted to agree with her, but she held her own and didn&#x2019;t avert her eyes. She didn&#x2019;t apologize for her opinion, a bad habit she&#x2019;d worked hard to break over the last year. Finally, he said, &#x201c;Call her in.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lucy contacted Officer Wyatt and asked him to bring Bella around to the back of the house. She met him outside the garage. &#x201c;Wait here, please,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>Bella was eyeing the cellar door with fear and apprehension. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Bella,&#x201d; Lucy said. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What d...</p></p><h2>Pele: Goddess of Hawaii&#39;s Volcanoes</h2><p>Presents lore associated with that impetuous and unpredictable, yet gentle and loving personality, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes, Pele.</p><p></p><h2>The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well-Being</h2><p>In winter 2014, a Tibetan monk lectured the world leaders gathered at Davos on the importance of Happiness.

He has conducted extensive research at Aztec sites.Fine scholarly history of the Aztecs from their 12th-century Toltec origins through the 16th-century Spanish conquest by Cort&#x201a;s. How was it that, landing on the Tabasco Coast in 1519, Hern&nbsp;n Cort&#x201a;s and his 500 soldiers--sons with no inheritance, failed planters, ex-gold-miners, freebooters--were able utterly to defeat Motecuhzoma, Aztec king and most feared ruler in Mesoamerica, and by 1521 conquer the Aztec confederation of city- states, with their population of 350,000? Here, Townsend (Curator, Department of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas/Art Institute of Chicago) draws from archaeological discoveries, Spanish records, and recent scholarship to explain the Conquest of Mexico and to illumine less generally known aspects of Aztec history: the everyday lives of kings and commoners; the interlocking calendars and festivals through which priests controlled their subjects; and the 400-year line of warrior/conquerors before Motecuhzoma. Ironically, the Aztec ritual of human sacrifice--in which the hearts of defeated warriors were torn beating from their bodies--contributed to the defeat of Motecuhzoma's own warriors: While Cort&#x201a;s's men fought to kill, Aztecs attempted to capture enemies for sacrifice. Elsewhere, Townsend's discussion of Aztec schooling reveals the depth of Aztec culture. There were two classes of schools--one for commoners, the other for nobility. In both, boys and girls were taught rhetoric, history, ritual dancing, and singing; in the calmecac for future leaders, the curriculum included law, architecture, arithmetic, astronomy, and agriculture. Interestingly, despite the Aztec success in the building arts and in supplying food for large cities, they had no beasts of burden- -everything was transported by water or by human porters; horses were introduced by the Spanish.

Beginning with a discussion of daily life in a Zen monastery, Nhat Hanh illustrates the character of Zen as practiced in Vietnam, and gives the reader clear explanations of the central elements of Zen practice and philosophy. Thorough attention is given to concepts such as Awareness and Impermanence, and to contemporary issues such as the conflicts between modern technology and spirituality. The final section includes a set of 43 koans from the 13th century Vietnamese master, Tran Thai Tong, which are translated here for the first time into English. Originally published in 1974, <i>Zen Keys</i> has been unavailable for several years but is now reissued by popular demand. Readers will find it as fresh today as when it was first written, and will be struck by the timelessness of its insights. What makes this work particularly compelling is that Nhat Hanh is able to invigorate what in other presentations may seem like empty abstract principles. The example he has set in his own life as a relentless advocate for peace brings strength and a realistic understanding to idealistic Buddhist goals. In <i>Zen Keys</i>, Thich Nhat Hanh presents the philosophy which has enabled him to be mindful of peace in every moment. An excellent introduction from Philip Kapleau (author of the classic <i>Three Pillars Of Zen</i> ) provides background on the emerging American Zen tradition.</p><p><b>Thich Nhat Hanh</b> is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, poet, and peacemaker who was nominated by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for the Nobel Peace Prize. The author of many books, including&nbsp;<i>Living Buddha, Living Christ</i>, he lives in France in the monastic community known as Plum Village and lectures and gives retreats regularly in North America.I<br><b>THE PRACTICE OF MINDFULNESS</b><br>THE LITTLE BOOK<br>I entered Tu Hioeu Zen Monastery in the Imperial City of Huee when I was sixteen years old. After a brief adjustment to monastic life, I presented myself before the monk responsible for my training and asked him to teach me the Zen ''way.'' He gave me a small book, <i>The Little Manual of Practice</i>, printed in Chinese characters, and asked me to learn it by heart.<br><br>I thanked him and went to my room to study. This book&#x2014;which is famous in Zen circles&#x2014;is divided into three parts: 1) ''Practice in Everyday Life''; 2) ''Essential Practices for a Novice''; and 3) ''The Teachings of Zen Master Kuai Chan.'' There is no philosophy at all in this book. All three parts discuss only practical problems. The first part teaches how to calm and concentrate the mind. The second discusses the precepts and other practices essential to monastic life. The third is a beautiful exhortation to Zen students to encourage them to remember that their time and life are precious and should not be vainly dissipated. I was assured that not only young novices begin with this book, but that monks even forty and fifty also followed its prescriptions.<br> <br>Before entering the monastery, I had already received some Western education, and I had the impression that the methods of teaching Buddhism in the monasteries were a little old-fashioned. First we were asked to learn the whole book by heart. Then we were to begin practicing without even being given the theoretical principles underlying it. I shared these concerns with another novice, who told me, ''This is the way followed here. If you want to learn Zen, you must accept it.'' So I resigned myself to beginning my practice in the traditional way.<br><br>The first part of <i>The Little Manual</i>, ''Practice in Everyday Life,'' contains <i>gathas</i>, short verses that bring the energy of mindfulness to each act of daily life. For example, when I wash my hands, I bring forth this thought: ''Water flows over these hands. May I use them skillfully to preserve our precious planet.'' When I am sitting in the meditation hall, I think: ''Sitting here is like sitting under the bodhi tree. My body is mindfulness itself, entirely free from distraction.'' And even when using the toilet, I say to myself: ''Defiled or immaculate, increasing or decreasing&#x2014;these concepts exist only in our minds. The reality of interbeing is unsurpassed.''<br><br>''Practice in Everyday Life'' contains a total of fifty gathas. We have to practice intelligently so that we can compose others when we need them. The ones in the manual are only examples. We should modify or even change them and write others more suited to our needs and contemporary conditions. Suppose I am about to use the telephone. There is no gatha for using the telephone in <i>The Little Manual</i>, because at the time the book was written there were no telephones. I have invented a number of gathas, like the following: ''Words can travel thousands of miles. May my words create mutual understanding and love. May they be beautiful as gems, as lovely as flowers.'' I have compiled a book of traditional and modern gathas entitled <i>Present Moment Wonderful Moment: Mindfulness Verses for Daily Living</i>, for your use in the practice.<br><br>When I was sixteen, I thought <i>The Little Manual</i> was written for young people and those just beginning the practice of Zen. I thought this method was just for preparation. But today, more than fifty years later, I know that <i>The Little Manual</i> is the very essence of Zen Buddhism.<br>NECESSARY AWARENESS<br>I remember a short conversation between the Buddha and a philosopher of his time.<br><br>''I have heard that Buddhism is a doctrine of enlightenment. What is your method? What do you practice every day?''<br><br>''We walk, we eat, we wash ourselves, we sit down . . .''<br><br>''What is so special about that? Everyone walks, eats, washes, sits down . . .''<br><br>''Sir, when we walk, we are aware that we are walking; when we eat, we are aware that we are eating. . . . When others walk, eat, wash, or sit down, they are generally not aware of what they are doing.''<br><br>In Buddhism, mindfulness is the key. Mindfulness is the energy that sheds light on all things and all activities, producing the power of concentration, bringing forth deep insight and awakening. Mindfulness is at the base of all Buddhist practice.<br><i>To shed light on all things?</i> This is the point of departure. If I live without mindfulness, in forgetfulness, I am, as Albert Camus says in his novel <i>The Stranger</i>, living ''like a dead person.'' The ancient Zen masters used to say, ''If we live in forgetfulness, we die in a dream.'' How many among us live ''like a dead person''! The first thing we have to do is to return to life, to wake up and be mindful of each thing we do. Are we aware when we are eating, drinking, sitting in meditation? Or are we wasting our time, living in forgetfulness?<br><i>To produce the power of concentration?</i> Mindfulness helps us focus our attention on and know what we are doing. Usually we are a prisoner of society. Our energies are dispersed here and there. Our body and our mind are not in harmony. To begin to be aware of what we are doing, saying, and thinking is to begin to resist the invasion by our surroundings and by all of our wrong perceptions. When the lamp of awareness is lit, our whole being lights up, and each passing thought and emotion is also lit up. Self-confidence is reestablished, the shadows of illusion no longer overwhelm us, and our concentration develops to its fullest. We wash our hands, dress, perform everyday actions as before, but now we are aware of our actions, words, and thoughts.<br>The practice of mindfulness is not only for novices. It is a lifelong practice for everyone, even the Buddha himself. The power of mindfulness and concentration is the spiritual force behind all of the great men and women of human history.<br><i>To bring forth deep insight and awakening?</i> The aim of Zen Buddhism is a clear vision of reality, seeing things as they are, and that is acquired by the power of concentration. This clear vision is enlightenment. Enlightenment is always enlightenment about something. It is not abstract.<br>MINDFULNESS<br>This process&#x2014;to <i>shed light on all things</i>, to <i>produce the power of concentration</i>, and <i>to bring forth deep insight and awakening</i>&#x2014;is called in Buddhism the ''Threefold Training'': <i>Sila</i> (precepts), <i>samadhi</i> (concentration), and <i>prajï¿½a</i> (insight). The word ''sila'' also means mindfulness, because the essence of the precepts is mindfulness. Precepts in Buddhism are not imposed by some outside authority. They arise from our own insight based on the practice of mindfulness. To be attached to the form without understanding the essence is to fall into what Buddhism calls <i>attachment to rules</i>. We realize insight by practicing mindfulness of our body, feelings, mind, and the objects of our mind, which are the world. That is why the first part of <i>The Little Manual</i> consists of mindfulness verses to memorize, and is called ''Practice in Everyday Life.''<br><br>When a scientist works in her laboratory, she does not smoke, eat sweets, or listen to the radio. The scientist refrains from doing these things not because they are immoral, but because she knows that they impede perfect concentration on the object of her study. It is the same in Zen. The precepts help us live in mindfulness.<br><br>In Zen, insight cannot be obtained just by the intellect&#x2014;study, hypothesis, analysis, synthesis. The Zen student must use his or her entire being as an instrument of realization; the intellect is only one part of our being, and a part that often pulls us away from living reality, which is the very substance of Zen. That is why <i>The Little Manual</i> does not present Buddhism as a theory&#x2014;it introduces the practitioner directly into the daily practice of Zen.<br><br>In the monastery, the practitioner does everything in mindfulness: carries water, looks for firewood, prepares food, plants lettuce. . . . Although we learn to meditate in the sitting position, we also learn to be mindful while carrying water, cooking, or planting lettuce. We know that to carry water is not merely a utilitarian action, it is the very essence of Zen. If we do not practice while carrying water, it is a waste of time to seclude ourselves in a monastery. But if we are mindful of each thing we do, even if we do the exact same things as others, we can enter directly into the world of Zen.<br><br>A Zen master observes the student in silence, while the student tries to bring the practice into every moment of life. The student may feel that he is not receiving enough attention, but his ways and acts cannot escape the observation of the master. The master can see if the student is or is not ''awake.'' If, for example, the student shuts the door noisily or carelessly, he is demonstrating a lack of mindfulness. Closing the door gently is not in itself a virtuous act, but awareness of the fact that you are closing the door is an expression of real practice. In this case, the master simply reminds the student to close the door gently, to be mindful. The master does this not only to respect the quiet of the monastery, but to point out to the student that he was not practicing mindfulness, that his acts were not majestic or subtle. It is said in Buddhism that there are ninety thousand ''subtle gestures'' to practice. These gestures and acts are expressions of the presence of mindfulness. All that we say, think, and do in mindfulness are described as having ''the flavor of Zen.''<br><br>If a practitioner hears himself reproached for lacking the ''flavor of Zen'' in what he says and does, he should recognize that he is being reminded to live his life in mindfulness.<br>II<br><b>A CUP OF TEA</b><br>SEEING INTO ONE'S OWN NATURE<br>In all Zen temples, there are fine portraits of Bodhidharma. The one in my monastery was a Chinese work in ink, depicting the Indian monk with intense, vigorous features. His eyebrows, eyes, and chin express a determined spirit. Bodhidharma lived, it is said, in the fifth century, and is considered to be the First Ancestral Teacher of Zen Buddhism in China. It might be that many of the things reported about his life are not valid historically, but the personality and mind of this monk, as described through the tradition, have made him the ideal person for all who aspire to Zen enlightenment.<br><br>His is the picture of someone who has attained perfect self-mastery, complete freedom, and tremendous spiritual power that allow him to regard happiness, unhappiness, and all vicissitudes of life with absolute calmness and clarity. The essence of his personality does not come from a position taken about the problem of absolute reality nor from an indomitable will, but from a deep insight into his own mind and all living reality. The Zen phrase used is ''seeing into one's own nature.'' When one has reached this enlightenment, one sees all wrong views dissolve within oneself. A new vision that produces deep peace, great tranquillity, and a spiritual strength characterized by the absence of fear is born. Seeing into one's own nature is the goal of Zen.<br>BODHIDHARMA'S STATEMENT<br>Seeing into one's own nature is not the fruit of study or research. It is a profound insight derived from living in the heart of reality, in perfect mindfulness. According to Bodhidharma, Zen is:<br>a special transmission outside the scriptures, not based on words or letters, a direct pointing to the heart of reality so that we might see into our own nature and wake up.<br>In the fifth century, when Bodhidharma came to China, Chinese Buddhists were studying Buddhist texts that had recently been translated. They were occupied more with systematizing the ideas and forming Buddhist sects than with practicing meditation. Bodhidharma's statement was like a thunder clap to wake them up and bring them to the practice and the experiential spirit of Buddhism.<br><br>Because it is like thunder, Bodhidharma's statement may seem extreme. But if we examine the relationship between Zen and Indian Buddhism, we see that Bodhidharma's pronouncement is very much in the same spirit as the teaching of the Buddha.<br><br>Bodhidharma said:<br>Zen has been transmitted directly by the Buddha and has nothing at all to do with the scriptures and doctrines you are studying.<br>At first glance, it may seem that Zen is a kind of secret teaching transmitted from master to disciple, not passed on by writing or comment&#x2014;a spiritual heritage that only initiates can understand. One could not even talk about teaching it, since Zen cannot be taught through symbols; it passes directly from master to student, from ''mind to mind.'' The image often used is a <i>seal</i> imprinted on the mind, not of wood, copper, or ivory, but a ''mind seal.'' The word ''transmission'' denotes the transmission of this mind seal. Zen itself <i>is</i> a mind seal. The enormous canon of Buddhist scriptures might be of Buddhism, but not of Zen Buddhism. Zen is not found in the scriptures, because Zen ''is not based on words or letters.'' This interpretation is often given to Bodhidharma's dictum by commentators. <br><br>This misunderstanding occurs because these commentators overlook the intimate ties between Zen and early Buddhism. The frowning upon describing ultimate reality by words is common to all teachings of the Buddha. Bodhidharma's statement is very much in this tradition and is merely a drastic way to bring people to a direct spiritual experience.<br>THE BUDDHIST REVOLUTION<br>Buddhism was born toward the end of the sixth century B.C.E. The word ''Buddhism'' comes from the Sanskrit verb Budh, which in the Vedic scriptures foremostly signifies ''to know,'' then ''to wake up.'' The one who knows, the one who wakes up, is called a buddha. The Chinese have translated the word ''buddha'' as ''an awakened person.'' <i>Buddhism is, therefore, a doctrine of awakening, a doctrine of insight and understanding.</i><br><br>But the Buddha made it known from the beginning that this awakening, this understanding, can only be acquired by the practice of the ''Way'' and not by studies or speculation. Liberation, in Buddhism, comes about through understanding and not by grace or merit.<br><br>The rise of Buddhism in India must be considered a new vision of humanity and life. This vision was expounded first as a reaction against the Brahmanic practices and beliefs that dominated the society of the time. What was this society? From the intellectual standpoint, the authority of the Brahmanic tradition dominated all: the Vedic revelation, the divine supremacy of Brahma, and the miraculous power of sacrifice were the three fundamentals one could not dispute. From the standpoint of belief, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva were the object of all the schools. From the philosophical standpoint, the thoughts of the Vedas and Upanishads were the basis of all philosophical concepts. Sankhya, Yoga, and the six philosophical schools were born and developed on this basis. Buddhism was thoroughly opposed to absolute Vedic authority and to all the points of view stemming from it. From the standpoint of belief, Buddhism rejected all deisms and all forms of sacrifice. From the social point of view, Buddhism combated the caste system, accepting untouchables in the order at the same level as a king. (Buddha, having met an untouchable who carried night soil, brought him to the edge of the river to wash him, then accepted him into the Buddhist community, despite the extreme protests of the others.) From the intellectual standpoint, it rigorously rejected the notion of a Self (Atman), which is the very heart of Brahmanism.</p><h2>Origo Stepping Stones Core Mathematics 2.0 Student Book A</h2><p>Origo Stepping Stones Core Mathematics 2.0 Student Book A by Burnett and Irons (Author) Product details Paperback Publisher: Origo Education (2017) ISBN-10: 1925168557 ISBN-13</p><p></p><h2>Medieval Life (DK Eyewitness Books)</h2><p>An illustrated look at various aspects of life in medieval Europe, covering everyday life, religion, royalty, and more.</p><p>The mysterious Middle Ages come alive in a pictorial overview of medieval life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn about the harsh lives of the peasants, the majestic manor houses of the feudal lords, the tournaments and romance of the royal court, the details of daily life, and many other remarkable aspects of this enigmatic era.&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Langley is a prolific author of books for children, with a special interest in history and the environment.

Yet his motives and intentions are not easy to divine, and it is Professor Warren&#39;s contention that concentration on the great crises of the reign can lead to distortion. This book is therefore a comprehensive reappraisal of the reign based, with rare understanding, on contemporary sources; it provides a coherent and persuasive revaluation of the man and the king, and is, in itself an eloquent and impressive achievement.</p><p>"This must surely rank as one of the classic historical biographies...it will hold its place not only as a work of reference but as a piece of historical literature."&#x2014;<i>Observer</i><br><br>"W. L. Warren has written a life of the great Angevin whose scholarship and fair-mindedness should make it the classic account for the next fifty years. . . .

An intimate of Dickens and of the Pre-Raphaelites Holman Hunt and Millais, Collins was called the "king of inventors" by his publisher. On the surface, he was charming, unpretentious, and extremely good company, beloved by men and women. Beneath this faï¿½ade, however, he was a complex and haunted man, addicted to laudanum, and his powerful, often violent novels revealed a dark side of Victorian life. He supported two common-law wives and their children, and as Peters shows, he provoked scandal by refusing to cloak his complicated love affairs in the customary hypocritical pretense of the period.</p><p>Having discovered a hitherto unknown autobiography by Wilkie Collins's mother, Peters draws on this document and on thousands of Collins's unpublished letters to create this provocative picture of his life and times. She describes in detail the saga of his exhausting struggle for better copyright protection for authors, especially for English authors in the United States. She has also studied the manuscripts of his novels, plays, and stories, including those which he did not complete, finding that some of his neglected novels turn out to be much more interesting than most readers realize today. This edition of the book has been supplemented to include an appendix describing Collins's "Tahitian" novel. Written when he was twenty, the manuscript of this work, <i>Iolï¿½ni</i>, was thought to have disappeared, but it has recently been rediscovered and sold to a private collector. For any Collins enthusiast, or for anyone interested in the literary history of the Victorian period, <i>The King of Inventors</i> provides a vivid account of Collins's unusual personal life in the context of his literary and artistic friendships and of newly revealed facts about the two women with whom he shared his "double life."</p><p>Originally published in 1993.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Certainly Collins's notorious private life invites the revisionary interpretation Peters shares with W. M. Clarke's Secret Life of Wilkie Collins (1991--not reviewed) and William Palmer's novel The Detective and Mr. Dickens (1990). Unlike the properly bourgeois Dickens, who labored to keep his affair with Ellen Ternan secret, Collins lived openly for many years with his common-law wife Caroline Graves while carrying on an equally open liaison with the young servant Martha Rudd--and acknowledged the children of both women as his own. Peters traces Collins's scorn for the hypocrisy of Victorian social convention--he was a far more steadfast and consistent opponent of Podsnappery than Dickens--to an early infatuation with continental mores that, in his novels, is transformed into a fascination with the problem of personal identities thrown into question by doubles, dreams, hallucinations, and guilty secrets. Determined that his own ``other self'' should escape the trap of marriage and respectability, Collins rooted the sensational plots of his best novels, from The Woman in White to The Moonstone, in a closely observed critique of English prudery and provincialism that Peters aptly compares to the work of Balzac and Flaubert, ascribing the decline of Collins's later novels--which lack the ``mythic, fairy-tale quality'' of his earlier syntheses of melodramatic nightmares and social pathology--to the dating of his call for change, overtaken by spreading literacy and feminine empowerment. Peters persuasively recasts Collins's sensationalism as a prophetic social modernism that explains both his meteoric rise and his later decline. Seldom has a novelist so completely expressed, in both life and art, the contradictions of his moment. (Photographs) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She begins with a discussion of feminism and Marxism, because (as she explains) the latter is the only contemporary political tradition to confront organized social dominance as a dynamic. She goes on to analyze feminist method (consciousness-raising) and the knowledge it reveals; and what she calls feminism unmodified (radical feminism) as a post-Marxist methodology.

Sounds like the backdrop of a horror movie, or in this post 9/11 world, something more sinister. But this actually happened in Elizabeth, New Jersey in the early 1950s, when beloved children&#x2019;s author Judy Blume (<em>Are You There God?

With no obvious explanation to cling to for comfort, this terrified community could only wait for something much bigger than the next shoe to drop. This is all big, mind-blowing stuff. But in her novel <em>In the Unlikely Event</em>, which like <em>Summer Sisters</em> is written for an adult audience, Blume travels back to that time and tells the more intimate stories within the larger one, to help us better comprehend the incomprehensible, and learn the lessons that are the only bright side of catastrophe. And the overarching moral, here, is to not let fear limit your possibilities. Through the various characters that inhabit this multigenerational tale, Blume beseeches us to not be afraid to get on a plane, take career risks, pursue your dreams, fall in love...After all, life is made up of unlikely events, and they &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t all bad.

Does absolute truth exist? Are humans truly unique? Is it possible to communicate with God? How much about the universe do we actually know? How could Jesus have been fully man and fully God? In Amazing Truths, Dr. Guillen explains that faith is not some outdated way of thinking. Faith is a necessary part of science, Christianity, and any intelligent, comprehensive, coherent worldview - vastly more powerful than even logic. Amazing Truths will expand your mind and bolster your faith.

Paper money, invented in Boston in 1698, was a classic of American ingenuity-and American disregard for authority and tradition. With the wry and admiring eye of a modern Tocqueville, <b>Jason Goodwin</b> has written a biography of the dollar, giving us the story of its astonishing career through the wilds of American history. <br><i>Greenback</i> looks at the dollar over the years as a form of art, a kind of advertising, a reflection of American attitudes, and a builder of empires. Goodwin shows us how the dollar rolled out the frontier and peopled the Plains; how it erected the great cities; how it expressed the urges of democracy and opportunity. And, above all, Goodwin introduces us to the people who championed-or ambushed-the dollar over the years: presidents, artists, pioneers, and frontiersmen; bankers, shady and upright; safecrackers, crooks, and dreamers of every stripe. It's a vast and colorful cast of characters, who all agreed on one thing: getting the money right was the key to unlocking liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br><i>Greenback</i> delves into folklore and the development of printing, investigates wildcats and counterfeiters, explains why a buck is a buck and how Dixie got its name. Like Goodwin's <i>Lords of the Horizons</i>, another story of empire, <i>Greenback</i> brings together an array of quirky detail and surprising-often hilarious-anecdote to tell the story of America through its best-beloved product.<br></p><p>Jason Goodwin's previous titles include<i> Lords of the Horizons, On Foot to the Golden Horn,</i> and <i>A Time for Tea</i>. He lives in England.<br>Most people find that what they really like about money is more of it, but only Americans started with a clean slate and a belief that if only they could hit on the right formula their dreams would come true. They experimented with money as no other nation ever had the chance to: wampum, paper currency, private bank notes, gold and <br>silver, government money, bank money. On the way, the people learned to strike a deal, fix a price, watch their interests. They learned how to conjure money not out of the thin air exactly, but out of the natural riches of the land and the <br>ingenuity of their own minds, and fell to arguing how much, relatively speaking, it was worth. <br>Settling that dispute, over the years, defined them as a nation.<br></p><h2>Lonely Man of Faith, The</h2><p>A discussion of the meaning of the life of faith in the modern world uses personal testimony, Kierkegaardian reflections, and an extended commentary to look at faith in politics, business, science, and other areas</p><p>Joseph B. Soloveitchik, the rabbi known as &#34;The Rav&#34; by his followers worldwide, was a leading authority on the meaning of Jewish law and prominent force in building bridges between traditional Orthodox Judaism and the modern world. In THE LONELY MAN OF FAITH, a soaring, eloquent essay first published in &#34;Tradition magazine in 1965, Soloveitchik investigates the essential loneliness of the person of faith in our narcissistic, materially oriented, utilitarian society. In this modern classic, Soloveitchik uses the story of Adam and Eve as a springboard, interweaving insights from such important Western philosophers as Kierkegaard and Kant with innovative readings of Genesis to provide guidance for the faithful in today&#39;s world. He explains prayer as &#34;the harbinger of moral reformation,&#34; and discusses with empathy and understanding the despair and exasperation of individuals who seek personal redemption through direct knowledge of a God who seems remote and unapproachable. He shows that while the faithful may become members of a religious community, their true home is &#34;the abode of loneliness.&#34; In a moving personal testimony, Soloveitchik demonstrates a deep-seated commitment, intellectual courage, and integrity that people of all religions will respond to.<b>Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik</b>&#x2014;known as the Rav&#x2014;was one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most preeminent and influential Jewish scholars. Born in 1903 in Belarus, Russia to a family renowned for its talmudic genius, and a graduate of the University of Berlin with a doctorate in philosophy, the Rav represented a halakhically-centered Orthodoxy engaged with the world. In the early 1930s, the Rav accepted the position of Chief Rabbi of Boston, the city that remained his home until his death in 1993. In the early 1940s, the Rav succeeded his father as the rosh yeshiva of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University, a position he held with great distinction until ill health forced his retirement in 1985. As rosh yeshiva, he became the spiritual mentor of thousands of American-trained rabbis and was universally acknowledged as the intellectual leader of an open and engaged Orthodoxy.</p><h2>The Day Boy and the Night Girl</h2><p>A Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator brings to life the classic tale of a boy and girl forced to live in separate worlds of darkness and light because of the spell of an evil witch</p><p>George MacDonald (1824 -1905) was a Scottish author, poet and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walter de la Mare, E. Nesbit and Madeleine L&#39;Engle. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his &#34;master&#34;: &#34;Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later,&#34; said Lewis, &#34;I knew that I had crossed a great frontier.&#34; G. K.

In&nbsp;<i>Life of the Party,</i>&nbsp;Bob Kealing offers the definitive portrait of Wise, a plucky businesswoman who divorced her alcoholic husband, started her own successful business, and eventually caught the eye of Tupperware inventor, Earl Tupper, whose plastic containers were collecting dust on store shelves.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tupperware Party that Wise popularized, a master-class in the soft sell, drove Tupperware's sales to soaring heights. It also gave minimally educated and economically invisible postwar women, including some African-American women, an acceptable outlet for making their own money for their families&#x2014;and for being rewarded for their efforts. With the people skills of Dale Carnegie, the looks of Doris Day, and the magnetism of Eva Peron, Wise was as popular among her many devoted followers as she was among the press, and she become the first woman to appear on the cover of <i>BusinessWeek</i> in 1954. Then, at the height of her success, Wise's ascent ended as quickly as it began.

It includes the Biography of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, his mission as a Prophet, his ranking as in the human history. Text is paragraphed by theme and theme is written in the margins on each page for easy reference. Its features include - (1) Field Testing the Communication of Divine Message: The unique feature of this translation is its field testing for over 3 1/2 years to improve the communication and understanding of the Divine Message. Translation passages were given to the New Muslim and Non-Muslim high school and college students for reading under the supervision of various Ulema (scholars). After reading, the person was asked to explain as to what he/she understood from the passage. If his/her understanding was the same as is in the Arabic Text of the Holy Qur&#39;an then we concluded that we have been successful in conveying the Divine Message properly. If his/her understanding was different than what the Qur&#39;anic verses were stating, we kept on rewording the translation until those verses were understood properly. It was tremendous patience on part of the participants. May Allah reward them all. (2) Simplicity: In this translation Simple Language and Direct Approach is used for appealing to the common sense of scholars and common people. (3) Understandability: There are no foot notes to refer and no commentary or lengthy explanations to read. All necessary explanations have been incorporated right there in the text with italic type setting to differentiate from the translation of the meanings of Qur&#39;anic Arabic Text. (4) Outline of Pertinent Information: Before the start of each Srah, information relating to its Period of Revelation, Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance has been presented as an outline. Then a summary of the preceding events has been tabulated for the reader to understand the histo! rical background to grasp the full meaning of the Divine Message. (5) Reviews, Input and Approvals: This project was started in 1991 and initial draft completed in 1994. Then the Translation was sent to different Ulema (Scholars) in Town and throughout United States for their review and input. After their reviews and input it was sent to Jme Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Egypt, Ummal Qur in Saudi Arabia and International Islamic University in Pakistan for their review, input and approval.

In doing so, he develops an innovative theory of image and myth.</p><p>Bruegel's paintings have always fascinated me, because they each contain a world - hence the much deserved comparison with Shakespeare. <p>These paintings are in fact miniatures on a tremendous scale. This means the spectator can never really get close enough to see them as the artist himself did - a handicap the publisher has overcome by offering a large number of details of the painting (100 illustrations, including a large fold-out of the entire painting). </p><p>More than any other painting by Bruegel "The Way to Calvary" encloses a world. It also offers a profoundly poetic cosmic view in a homespun idiom. For the warm-hearted, earthy folk quality of his art does not prevent Bruegel from having a touch of the sublime - as can be seen in the group surrounding the fainting Mary in the foreground. </p><p>Going through all this gradually allows one to realize that a picture like this one is much more than a representation of an event (a twofold event, since it relates both Christ's Passion and the religious and political repression of Flanders in Bruegel's day). It is above all an extraordinarily eloquent expression of the breadth and depth of Bruegel's own conception of human experience with its ordeals and its hopes.</p>Michael Francis Gibson is currently editor of UNESCO&#39;s World Heritage Review.</p><h2>Little Hazelnut</h2><p>Winner of he 2018 British Book Design &amp; Production Award for Children s Trade 0 to 8 Years.

Just like Elliott Wave Principle, its super-bullish predecessor from 1978, this updated and abridged paperback version of At the Crest of the Tidal Wave presents a scenario that appears too dramatic and specific to be more than unfounded conjecture. However, the author&#39;s forecasting tool is again the only one that has proved its value in addressing future market probabilities. The result is social science at its best. If even half of the author&#39;s forecasts come to pass, the world of finance just a few years hence will be immeasurably different from what it is today. Using the same precise approach that he employed a month after the 1982 low at Dow 777 to forecast a great bull market that would carry the Dow Industrial Average to near 4000, Robert Prechter now calls for a slow motion economic earthquake that will register 11 on the financial Richter scale. The Great Asset Mania of recent years is in its final euphoric months, he says, and the next event will be a collapse of historic proportion. If you are already well versed in the Wave Principle and prepared for the change that is coming, then ignore this book. If you are not, then devour it cover to cover. Be prepared for a shift in the tectonic plates that make up your mind&#39;s notions about financial causality. Above all, get ready for a violent shaking of your faith in conventional economic wisdom.</p><h2>Fit for America: Health, Fitness Sport and American Society</h2><p>Provides a history of American attitudes towards fitness prior to World War II, looks at gymnastics, calisthenics, and pseudo-medical treatments, and examines changes in diet and dress</p><p>"It does seem to me that there would not be so much pain and suffering . . . if there were no doctors . . . ." The skepticism reflected in this statement by a New York farmer in 1853, quoted in this fascinating study of medicine, American culture, and values, was definitely a sign of the times. Three medical philosophies and their offshootsheroic, botanic, and homeopathicwere prevalent in the 19th century, often practiced by doctors with little more than six weeks of training. No wonder the skepticism of the massesand the high mortality rates. With meticulous scholarship, keen insight, and clear writing, Green shows how religion, the frontier spirit, ignorance about sanitation, and the national drive for perfection spawned these contrasting philosophies of health. A lively social history with many lessons for our own time, recommended for public and academic libraries. Jack Forman, Mesa Coll.

Original. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Several years ago, while dutifully helping clean out her parents' basement, Wendy McClure struck comic gold when she discovered an intact and well-preserved collection of Weight Watchers Recipe Cards from 1974: <blockquote> They were neatly arranged in their own plastic file box. Plenty of the dishes seemed normal enough, but as I flipped through them, some of the recipes began to alarm me. And then I found the card for the Rosy Perfection Salad. I fell over. I laughed so hard I started coughing, and I fell back on the floor and I waved the card at my mom, who just rolled her eyes. 'Can I please have these? <i>Please?</i>' I begged. 'What do you want them for?' she asked. 'To cook?' 'No,' I said. She let me have them. I think they might have been my grandma's, but she never copped to actually buying them. Nobody else did, either. </blockquote> What McClure unearthed were astonishingly grim, unintentionally hilarious recipe cards (sample dishes: Aspic-Glazed Lamb Loaf and Snappy Mackerel Casserole) containing no nutritional information but illustrated with eerie photos clearly staged by a props department not averse to self-medicating. Compelled to share her discovery with the world, McClure posted the cards on a website, framing each with her own side-splitting and appropriately warped comments. <i>The Amazing Mackerel Pudding Plan</i>--a titled borrowed from one of the myriad improbably named recipes contained within--unleashes the entire god-awful collection. No review can quite capture the horrors of the recipe cards or the genius of McClure's riotous quips. Suffice to say these are milk-through-the-nose, tears-down-the-cheeks funny and a striking reminder of just how bent the 1970s were. Worth the price for the Molded Asparagus Salad and the Stuffed Apples Ganges cards alone. <i>--Kim Hughes</i>Wendy McClure holds an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.

Vicious mutilation, a penchant for arcane symbols, and a seemingly random choice of victim are his most distinctive peculiarities. Detective Inspector Oskar Rheinhardt summons a young disciple of Freud - his friend Dr. Max Liebermann &#x2014; to assist him with the case. The investigation draws them into the sphere of Vienna&#x2019;s secret societies &#x2014; a murky underworld of German literary scholars, race theorists, and scientists inspired by the new evolutionary theories coming out of England. At first, the killer&#x2019;s mind seems impenetrable &#x2014; his behaviour and cryptic clues impervious to psychoanalytic interpretation; however, gradually, it becomes apparent that an extraordinary and shocking rationale underlies his actions. . . . <br> <br> Against this backdrop of mystery and terror, Liebermann struggles with his own demons. The treatment of a patient suffering from paranoia erotica (a delusion of love) and his own fascination with the enigmatic Englishwoman Amelia Lydgate raises doubts concerning the propriety of his imminent marriage. To resolve the dilemma, he must entertain the unthinkable &#x2014; risking opprobrium and accusations of cowardice.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Frank Tallis is a writer and practicing clinical psychologist. He has published seven non-fiction works (including <b>Changing Minds: The History of Psychotherapy as an Answer to Human Suffering</b>; and <b>Hidden Minds: A History of the Unconscious</b>.) His new novel, <b>Lovesick</b>, is also published by Century.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>The Italian lunged forward. He was a small, lean man, but very muscular. Any disadvantage he suffered because of his lack of height was amply compensated for by his sharp eye and astonishing speed. <br>Liebermann successfully deflected the foil&#x2019;s thrust but lost his balance. He was unable to produce a counterattack and his opponent advanced yet again. The tip of the Italian&#x2019;s foil came perilously close to the protective quilting over Liebermann&#x2019;s heart. Recovering his footing, Liebermann chose to make a <i>pass&#x17d;</i>&#x2013;darting behind the Italian and taking a few steps backward. A trickle of sweat slid down his hot cheek. The Italian shrugged and walked away, flexing his foil in a gesture of indifference. After a few paces he swung around and adopted the preparatory stance, his chin tilted upward in an attitude of arrogance. Liebermann edged forward. <br>The Italian seemed to relax, his foil wilting a little in an apparently weaker grip. Liebermann noticed the subtle change and struck. A violent brassy clang was followed by the shriek of scraping metal: the Italian&#x2019;s foil yielded, offering no resistance. Liebermann congratulated himself, believing that he had taken his opponent by surprise&#x2013;but the concession was merely tactical. The Italian&#x2019;s blade deftly flicked around Liebermann&#x2019;s, displacing it with a powerful grazing action, and, once again, the tip of his opponent&#x2019;s foil effortlessly penetrated Liebermann&#x2019;s defenses. Liebermann retreated, executing a series of deflective maneuvers that barely contained the Italian&#x2019;s renewed fierce attack. <br>{ <i>3 } </i><br><i>Frank Tallis </i><br>They circled each other, occasionally touching blades in glancing contact. <br>&#x201c;You should have anticipated my <i>froissement, </i>Herr Doctor,&#x201d; said the Italian gruffly. He tapped his temple and added: &#x201c;Think, Herr Doctor! If you do not think, all is lost.&#x201d; <br>Liebermann examined the blank oval of Signore Barbasetti&#x2019;s mask, eager to observe some mark of humanity&#x2013;a conciliatory expression or the glimmer of a smile, perhaps. The mesh, however, was impenetrable. <br>Their foils clashed again&#x2013;blades flashing in a shaft of early-morning sunlight. A swarm of lazy dust motes was sucked into a miniature cyclone of displaced air. <br>Barbasetti produced a feint, switching from one line of attack to another, forcing Liebermann to draw back. However, the young doctor retained his composure and made a move that he intended should fail, thus provoking a predictable and powerful thrust from Barbasetti. Liebermann dodged and struck the forte of the Italian&#x2019;s foil as he stumbled past&#x2013;Barbasetti almost lost his grip. <br>&#x201c;Bravo, Herr Doctor,&#x201d; Barbasetti said, and laughed. &#x201c;An excellent <i>falso</i>!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, signor.&#x201d; <br>Barbasetti came to a halt and lifted his blade, scrutinizing it closely. &#x201c;Please excuse me, Herr Doctor.&#x201d; <br>Barbasetti walked to the other side of the drill hall and pressed the hilt of his foil against the surface of a battered wooden table. He then hung a small iron weight from the tip and watched the metal blade bend. Its gentle curvature elicited an equivocal grunt from the watchful Italian. <br>&#x201c;Is everything all right, signor?&#x201d; Liebermann asked. <br>&#x201c;Yes, I think so,&#x201d; Barbasetti replied. The Italian raised himself up, marched back, and warned his student: <i>&#x201c;En garde.&#x201d; </i><br>{ <i>4 } </i><br><i>Vienna Blood </i><br>Immediately they were engaged, Liebermann&#x2019;s foil sliding along his opponent&#x2019;s blade until the hand guards crashed together. The fencing master pushed and Liebermann was thrown back: he landed awkwardly, but was nevertheless able to execute an impressive flying parry. <br>Barbasetti disengaged. &#x201c;Much better.&#x201d; <br>Liebermann noticed that the button at the end of his foil was trembling&#x2013;he was feeling tired. After his lesson, he would have coffee and croissants in the little coffeehouse close to the Anatomical Institute. He would need something in his stomach to keep him going. . . . <br><i>&#x201c;En garde!&#x201d;</i>Barbasetti barked again. The Italian had noticed that his student&#x2019;s mind had begun to wander. Liebermann was astonished by the fencing master&#x2019;s insight. <br>Again their blades connected, and the plangent clatter of contending steel filled the hall. Liebermann thought that Signore Barbasetti was tiring too. His pace had slackened slightly and his movements were less balletic. The Italian deflected Liebermann&#x2019;s lunge, but failed to resume his guard. Observing the exposed chest protector, Liebermann recognized a rare opportunity. Excited by the prospect of victory, he raised his foil, ready to strike. <br>But the blow was never delivered. <br>His body froze, paralyzed by the inexplicable pressure that he felt against his heart. Dropping his gaze, he contemplated the tip of Signore Barbasetti&#x2019;s foil, which had found its home precisely above the intercostal space separating ribs five and six. <br>Barbasetti pushed, and the cold steel curved upward. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said Liebermann. <br>&#x201c;You were not concentrating, Herr Doctor,&#x201d; said the Italian. &#x201c;Such an error would certainly lose you a competition . . . and of course, in some circumstances, your life.&#x201d; <br>{ <i>5} </i><br><i>Frank Tallis </i><br>Barbasetti lowered his foil and then raised it in salute. <br>Liebermann returned the gesture politely. In spite of the fencing master&#x2019;s dramatic declaration, the young doctor was ashamed to find that he was still thinking of the little coffeehouse near the Anatomical Institute: crisp flakes of buttery pastry, a pot of plum jam, and a cup of very strong black coffee. <br>{ <i>6} </i></p><h2>Before the Darkness Falls</h2><p>The third book in the best-selling <i>Savannah Quartet</i> skillfully blends romantic fiction with fact to create a moving and memorable story of the Old South.</p><p><b>Continuing the saga of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Savannah</i> and <i>To See Your Face Again,</i> Eugenia Price, one of the world&#x2019;s most beloved storytellers, weaves a gloriously moving tale of the Old South&#x2014;of destinies bound by the rumblings of war&#x2014;and passion freed by the power of love.</b> <br> <br> <i>Georgia, 1842. </i>In this grand and passionate era of American history, forged by the dreams of extraordinary men and women, the McKay, Browning, and Stiles families find themselves experiencing love, hardship, and pain in the great Southern city of Savannah.

Or messily do both, not necessarily in any order. Charlie didn&#x2019;t feel that good himself. It had been a busy, largely sleepless forty-eight hours since his emergency London assigning, and he&#x2019;d never liked mortuaries anyway. The unease wasn&#x2019;t helped by a mortuary assistant four autopsy tables away, munching a meat-overflowing sandwich. The grayness of the sandwich filling matched the color of the surrounding corpses, including that of the man around whom they were grouped.<br>From the size of the entry wound in the base of the skull, Charlie calculated the bullet was from a Russian-manufactured 9mm Makarov, its tip cut into a dum-dum cross to flatten on initial impact in order to take away on exit the entire face, including both jawbones. The fingertips on the right hand had individually been burned away, either by acid or heat. The pathologist, a fat, dough-faced man who hadn&#x2019;t been introduced by name, declared the amputation of the left arm to have been a surgical operation, carried out several years earlier. &#x201c;But not particularly well,&#x201d; he added, professionally critical. &#x201c;A hurried job.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s obviously a gangland execution,&#x201d; announced the only Russian whose name Charlie knew so far. Sergei Romanovich Pavel had been identified as a senior investigator from Moscow&#x2019;s Organized Crime Bureau.<br>Charlie looked around the group, waiting for the question. When no one asked he said, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s it obvious?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a trademark killing, the way they always do it. Bullet in the back of the head, after the torture punishment for what ever he did wrong,&#x201d; lectured Pavel. &#x201c;You are.... ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;London-based embassy security,&#x201d; said Charlie, wondering which of the men facing him across the metal slab was from the Federal&#x2019;naya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or FSB, which replaced the internal directorate of the former KGB. The presence of the internal intelligence agency was inevitable after the finding of a murdered man in the garden of the British embassy; Charlie guessed it to be the thin, balding man holding back from any part in the stilted discussion.<br>The bespectacled, sparse-haired Pavel smiled, patronizingly. &#x201c;There is, regrettably, a lot of organized crime in the city. We&#x2019;ve come to recognize their methodology.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He was very obviously tortured,&#x201d; endorsed the pudgy pathologist, pointing toward the murdered man&#x2019;s clothes bundled into a see-through plastic sack. &#x201c;The jacket and shirt are clotted with blood. The bullet would have smashed most of the teeth, making an identification difficult from dental records. But I&#x2019;d guess most of the teeth were pulled out while he was still alive, to cause that degree of blood loss. Probably a lot more was done to him, as well. They usually take the eyes out...&#x201d; He went back to the body. &#x201c;See the ligature bruising on the wrist, as well as his ankles and across the chest? That&#x2019;s where he would have thrashed in agony against what ever they restrained him with...&#x201d;<br>It was the Russian Foreign Ministry man whose stomach erupted. The man managed to reach a deep-basined sink before being violently and repeatedly sick, groaning as he retched. Jeremy Dawkins, the embassy diplomat, looked determinedly away, his lips tightly clamped.<br>Charlie said: &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you tell us at the beginning that all the labels and makers&#x2019; marks have been removed from the clothes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re bagged up. They&#x2019;re clearly Russian and I thought they&#x2019;d be needed for forensic examination.&#x201d;<br>Turning back to Pavel, Charlie said, &#x201c;Is that another gangland trademark? Removing all manufacturers&#x2019; details from the clothing, as well as taking away the face and burning off the finger ends to prevent any identification?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t usually do that,&#x201d; conceded the Russian detective.<br>Going back to the medical examiner, Charlie said, &#x201c;How do you think the fingertips were destroyed?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Forced over a flame or a hot plate,&#x201d; suggested the man. &#x201c;Acid, possibly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are any of the fingers broken?&#x201d; persisted Charlie.<br>The pathologist frowned, needing to go back to his notes. &#x201c;No, they weren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, we&#x2019;ve got a body bruised by his binding from the thrashing agony of what was being done to him, but without the fingers being broken where he tried to keep his hand away from a flame or hot plate?&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;Which would, by the way, have burned the torturers trying to hold the fingers over the heat.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; allowed the doctor.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think his fingers were held over anything hot,&#x201d; argued Charlie. &#x201c;I think the tips were burned off by an acidlike agent; that&#x2019;s why the wrist is so marked, more deeply than anywhere else.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you going to tell us the point of this cross-examination?&#x201d; demanded Pavel.<br>&#x201c;Looks to me as if a very determined effort was made to conceal who the man was,&#x201d; said Charlie.<br>&#x201c;Which we will do our utmost to discover,&#x201d; promised the man whom Charlie guessed to be from the FSB.<br>&#x201c;The body was found in the grounds of the British embassy,&#x201d; reminded Charlie. &#x201c;Technically, the embassy and the grounds in which it is built is British, not Russian territory. This is a murder committed on British soil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we need to become distracted by diplomatic technicalities,&#x201d; broke in Dawkins.<br>&#x201c;But if we are being technical, I am not entirely satisfied that the murder was committed on British soil,&#x201d; challenged the pathologist. &#x201c;From my preliminary examination at the murder scene, I&#x2019;d say the body was dumped in the grounds after the man was shot: there wasn&#x2019;t sufficient blood or physical debris around him. And if he were killed elsewhere it is a Russian investigation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Surely, until it actually becomes an investigation, it should be a joint operation?&#x201d; pressed Charlie.<br>The ashen-faced ministry official came back into the group. He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry... I&#x2019;ve never been in a place like this before.&#x201d; To Charlie he said, &#x201c;Every cooperation will be extended. It&#x2019;s a very unpleasant business. Your country&#x2019;s need to be involved is most regrettable.&#x201d;<br>Not regretted by me, thought Charlie. He smiled at the Russian detective. &#x201c;I look forward to our working together. I presume you&#x2019;re based at Ulitsa Petrovka?&#x201d;<br>Pavel frowned. &#x201c;You know Moscow that well?&#x201d;<br>Charlie felt a spurt of annoyance at his smart-assed mention of the location of the organized crime bureau headquarters. It gave them a pointer they didn&#x2019;t need to have and which he hadn&#x2019;t intended to give them. But if the thin-faced, balding man was FSB, then a background intelligence check was automatic. With no alternative, Charlie said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve served a posting here before.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which explains your excellent Russian,&#x201d; said the man, smilingly, whom Charlie suspected was FSB.<br>It didn&#x2019;t necessarily, but Charlie was anxious not to stray any further. &#x201c;And why I was seconded here specifically to inquire into this murder,&#x201d; he said.

But as a how-to guide, it is lacking. Information for homeowners is contained in a few sidebars, such as "Wallpaper Selection Today," and presented in vague terms: "Some companies do manufacture papers that reproduce designs used during the 19th century." The authors tell us how the Victorians chose to design their homes and the reasons for their various selections, but in such dry prose that it's difficult to imagine they are discussing an era known for its exciting diversity and burgeoning opulence. And despite abundant quotes from Godey's Lady's Book and other charming sources, this tome is boring.

Burroughs </b>(1914-1997) was an American author, painter, and spoken-word performer who has had a wide-ranging influence on American culture. Jack Kerouac called him the ''greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift.'' Norman Mailer declared him ''the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius.'' A postmodernist and a key figure of the beat generation, he focused his art on a relentless subversion of the moral, political, and economic conventions of modern American society, as reflected in his often darkly humorous and sardonic satire. He wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six short-story collections, and four collections of essays. No fewer than five books of his interviews and correspondence have been published. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 and in the following year was appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.<br><br>''It's a comedy . . . a nightmare . . .

The Second Day at Gettysburg: The Attack and Defense of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863, by David L. Shultz and Scott L. Mingus Sr. aptly demonstrates that there is indeed still much to learn about the war&#x2019;s largest and bloodiest battle.<br><br>Based upon a faulty early-morning reconnaissance, General Robert E. Lee decided to attack up the Emmitsburg Road in an effort to collapse the left flank of General George Meade&#x2019;s Army of the Potomac and decisively defeat it. The effort got underway when General James Longstreet&#x2019;s First Corps troops crushed General Sickles&#x2019; Peach Orchard salient and turned north and east to drive deeply into the Union rear. A third Confederate division under Richard Anderson, part of A. P. Hill&#x2019;s Third Corps, joined in the attack, slamming one brigade after another into the overstretched Union line stitched northward along the Emmitsburg Road. The bloody fighting stair-stepped its way up Cemetery Ridge, tearing open a large gap in the center of the Federal line that threatened to split the Union army in two. The fate of the Battle of Gettysburg hung in the balance.<br><br>Despite the importance of the position, surprisingly few Union troops were available to defend the yawning gap on the ridge. Major General Winfield S. Hancock&#x2019;s Second Corps had been reduced to less than one division when his other two were sucked southward to reinforce the collapsing Third Corps front. Reprising Horatio at the Bridge, the gallant commander cobbled together a wide variety of infantry and artillery commands and threw them into the action, refusing to yield even one acre of ground. The long and intense fighting included hand-to-hand combat and the personal heroics of which legends are made.<br><br>Veteran Gettysburg authors Shultz and Mingus merge their subject matter expertise and keen understanding of the complex undulating terrain and physical features to produce the most detailed study of this action ever written. In addition to demonstrating how the fighting on the far Union left directly affected the combat to come in the center of General Meade&#x2019;s line, the authors also address some of the most commonly overlooked aspects of the fighting: what routes did some of the key units take to reach the front? What could the commanders actually see, and when could they see it? How did the fences, roads, farms, trees, ravines, creeks, and others obstacles directly affect tactical decisions, and ultimately the battle itself? <br><br>Based upon extensive research and graced with dozens of photographs and detailed original maps, The Second Day at Gettysburg offers a balanced, compelling, and ultimately satisfying account of one of the most overlooked and yet important aspects of the defining battle of the American Civil War.</p><p>Dave Shultz and I have each been interested in the battle of Gettysburg for decades. In my case, three of my ancestors, the Chambers boys from Marshall County, West Virginia, fought on the second day at Gettysburg in the 7th WV against the Louisiana Tigers on East Cemetery Hill. I have long been fascinated by their story. When Ted Savas asked if I would consider working with Dave on this new book (which is the culmination of 11 years of Dave&#39;s meticulous research), I accepted his offer and added my own twist to the narrative. This has resulted in a blend of Dave&#39;s excellent terrain studies with my love for human interest stories and personal accounts of the battle. We think you will be pleased with our collaboration on this new work.--Scott Mingus, York PA"This new book in the fascinating events that occurred alongthe Union center on July 2, 1863, by authors David L. Shultz and Scott MingusSr. is the most detailed tactical account of decision-making, leadership, and rawcourage published to date. The intensity of the action and eye-levelperspective of <i>The Second Day at Gettysburg</i> will transport readers back to thatbattlefield, where muskets bark and cannons roar. After reading the multitudeof personal stories threaded into the narrative, one might ask, 'Would I havedone so well had I been there?' Long overlooked, this well-researched study isan important addition to any Civil War or Gettysburg bookshelf." - Eric J.Wittenberg, award-winning author of <i>The Devil's to Pay: John Buford atGettysburg</i> and <i>Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions</i><br><br>"Much has been written about the southern end of thebattlefield on Gettysburg's second day (the bloodiest of the three), but surprisinglylittle about the attack and defense of the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. Here,finally, is the deeply researched and scholarly presentation it has longdeserved. Devotes of battlefield minutia will delight at the level of coverage,from the arrival of the armies and Captain Johnston's early-morningreconnaissance that set General Lee's plans in motion, to the myriad decisions,movements, and operations on both sides that led to the massive assault itself(which is covered in breathtaking detail) and the heroic defense. What makesthis study especially unique is the authors' grasp of the terrain, and how itand the physical features of the field (roads, buildings, fences, etc.)dictated decision-making, tactics, and ultimately, the outcome. The dozens ofexcellent original maps and photos make this perfect for armchair readers or asa narrative to take right onto the battlefield itself." - J. David Petruzzi,award-winning author of <i>The Complete Gettysburg Campaign Guide</i> and <i>TheGettysburg Campaign in Numbers and Losses</i> (with Steven Stanley)<br><br>"The fighting on July 2 along the Federal center continuesto fascinate readers. What would have been the battle's outcome if Anderson'sConfederate attack had been able to break Hancock's defense? Of course, we willnever know (or agree upon) the answer, but Shultz and Mingus in their new <i>TheSecond Day at Gettysburg</i> have provided plenty of fresh information, insight,and fascinating terrain details, along with many personal human interest stories,to give Gettysburg's students ammunition to continue the debate." - James A.Hessler, award-winning author of <i>Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg</i> (with Wayne E.Motts) and <i>Sickles at Gettysburg</i>.</p><h2>Samurai Executioner, Vol. 1: When the Demon Knife Weeps</h2><p>From the creators of Lone Wolf and Cub comes Samurai Executioner. It&#39;s true! Few know of this precursor to the legendary ronin saga, but before Koike and Kojima created Itto Ogami, they created Kubikiri Asa, better known to Lone Wolf readers as Decapitator Asaemon. He was the equal to Itto, bearer of the sword Onibocho, the man charged with the duty of testing the swords for the shogun. Shogun Executioner is based on the decapitator himself, in life before his fatal duel with Lone Wolf. Expect the same legendary drama, frantic action, and stoic samurai stature, combined with the exemplary art and storytelling that made Lone Wolf and Cub one of the most popular and influential comic books in the world!</p><p>The 28-volume Lone Wolf and Cub is one of the least conventional-looking <i>manga </i>series to Westerners. Instead of the big-eyed people, sketchy backdrops, and sticky-cute aura of youth <i>manga,</i> it features realistically rendered Japanese, settings that Americans will recognize from historical samurai movies, and the atmosphere of such films. This book inaugurates an English-translation series of the Lone Wolf and Cub spin-off Samurai Executioner, which is a stunner in every way. Like youth <i>manga,</i> it has plenty of violence--but graphic, realistic violence. Unlike youth <i>manga, </i>it has plenty of sex--brutal and perfunctory, though hardly pornographic (no visible genitals). Dialogue is sparse; period terms are merely transliterated (a brief glossary is appended). Best of all, imagery, angles of vision, composition, and visual-narrative procedure bespeak Kojima's deep knowledge of classic Japanese cinema (the late artist's last works were graphic novelizations of Kurosawa films). The five stories here are crime shockers with medieval-Japanese-style police-procedural elements; the first also introduces the executioner, thereafter a secondary character, though always around at each tale's climax. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.</p><p>When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccolï¿½ Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>Starring Miss Marple: Including a Murder is Announced, the Body in the Library, Murder with Mirrors</h2><p>Brings together three of Miss Jane Marple&#39;s most celebrated cases: A Murder is Announced, The Body in the Library, and Murder with Mirrors</p><p></p><h2>Essential Brain Injury Guide</h2><p>&#34;This is the most comprehensive brain injury guide I&#39;ve ever seen.

Targeted by enemy bombers, the BBC had turned its concert hall into a dormitory for both sexes, and personal chaos rivaled the political. The tense relationship between two departmental directors is at the center of Human Voices, as is Annie, a sixteen-year-old assistant who falls hopelessly in love with the monstrously selfish one. Reading this intimate glimpse behind the scenes of the BBC in its heyday, &#34;one is left with the sensation,&#34; William Boyd wrote in London Magazine, &#34;that this is what is was really like.&#34;</p><p>In 1940, as World War II heats up, the BBC is doing its best to fulfill its singular mission: saving Britain from despondency and panic without resorting to lies. "Broadcasting House was in fact dedicated to the strangest project of the war, or of any war, that is, telling the truth." Surrounded by sandbags that are literally going to seed, this London landmark has come to resemble an ocean liner both inside and out. "With the best engineers in the world," Penelope Fitzgerald observes, "and a crew varying between the intensely respectable and the barely sane, it looked ready to scorn any disaster of less than Titanic scale." Though there are no icebergs in <i>Human Voices</i>, Fitzgerald's perfectly pitched 1980 novel, danger does loom on several decks. <p> For a start, the Department of Recorded Programmes (DRP) is in for a shakeup. Sam Brooks, its director (RPD), has long ruffled the Controllers' feathers owing to his need for several nubile assistants--no wonder his unit is sometimes labeled the Seraglio. This time, however, his penchant for young women isn't the issue. Instead, it's the fact that RPD takes his calling too seriously. For instance, in response to a directive that England's heritage not be lost, he and a crack team once spent two weeks recording a creaky church door in Heather Lickington. At this point, only Jeff Haggard, the Director of Programme Planning (DPP), can save Sam; but having done that for the past 10 years, DPP is suffering from severe BBC battle fatigue. </p><p> As Penelope Fitzgerald follows this pair--and several other employees--her novel melds tragedy, surrealism, and satire into one endlessly surprising whole. As ever, she captures the momentous in the smallest moment--the joys of an orange in wartime, the pleasures of piano tuning, and the painful twists of love. When the newest member of the Seraglio makes the mistake (or is it?) of falling for RPD, she does so </p><blockquote> absolutely, and hers must have been the last generation to fall in love without hope in such an unproductive way. After the war the species no longer found it biologically useful, and indeed it was not useful to Annie. Love without hope grows in its own atmosphere, and should encourage the imagination, but Annie's grew narrower. </blockquote> As is evident in this acute passage, and in virtually every other in <i>Human Voices</i>, Fitzgerald can pivot from sorrow to humor by way of pessimism and desire and then back again. If you so much as blink you'll miss one of the book's key turns or unexpected pleasures. No matter. Penelope Fitzgerald's human comedy always rewards rereading. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>Mariner paperback 1999 Previous ISBN 978-0-395-95617-5</p><h2>French Wines: The Essential Guide to the Wines and Wine Growing Regions of France</h2><p>Profiling hundreds of wines from every region, major vineyard, and appellation of France, French Wines is equally useful to the cultured connoisseur as well as the beginner who doesn&#39;t know Pouilly Fume from Pouilly Fuisse.

It was the stark contrast of Apple&#x2019;s ways that made Segall appreciate the power of Simplicity&#x2014;and inspired him to help others benefit from it.<br><br>In <i>Insanely Simple</i>, you&#x2019;ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You&#x2019;ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster, sometimes saving millions in the process. You&#x2019;ll also learn, for example, how to:<br><br>ï¿½ Think Minimal: Distilling choices to a minimum brings clarity to a company and its customers&#x2014;as Jobs proved when he replaced over twenty product models with a lineup of four.<br>ï¿½ Think Small: Swearing allegiance to the concept of &#x201c;small groups of smart people&#x201d; raises both morale and productivity.<br>ï¿½ Think Motion: Keeping project teams in constant motion focuses creative thinking on well-defined goals and minimizes distractions.<br>ï¿½ Think Iconic: Using a simple, powerful image to symbolize the benefit of a product or idea creates a deeper impression in the minds of customers.<br>ï¿½ Think War: Giving yourself an unfair advantage&#x2014;using every weapon at your disposal&#x2014;is the best way to ensure that your ideas survive unscathed.<br><br>Segall brings Apple&#x2019;s quest for Simplicity to life using fascinating (and previously untold) stories from behind the scenes.

As the man who came up with the iconic iMac name, which launched one of the most successful product lines in history, Segall played a pivotal role in reviving Apple from near death. His close working relationship with Jobs allows him to provide insight into how Jobs&#x2019; obsession with simplicity became the driving force that informs every decision the company makes to this day, from product design to advertising, even down to the packing boxes. Segall contrasts this Apple mind-set with those of companies like Dell, Intel, and Microsoft, where complexity and a dizzying array of product choices only serve to confuse and distract customers. His recounting of high-level meetings, ad campaigns, and product-naming sessions reveals much about how Jobs&#x2019; unyielding, brutally honest approach pushed aside rivals, teams of lawyers, and everyone else who said it couldn&#x2019;t be done to remake Apple into one of the most admired and valuable companies in the world. --David Siegfried</p><h2>Who Is My Neighbor?

Written by a teacher, psychologist and meditation master of international renown, this is a warm, inspiring and, above all, practical book. Its gentle wisdom will guide you through the ups and downs of contemporary living, such as addiction, psychological and emotional healing, problems with relationships and the difficulties of achieving a balanced life of simplicity.</p><p>In undertaking a spiritual life, we must make certain that our path is connected with our heart, according to author and Buddhist monk Jack Kornfield. Since 1974 (long before it gained popularity in the 1990s), Kornfield has been teaching westerners how to integrate Eastern teaching into their daily lives. Through generous storytelling and unmitigated warmth, Kornfield offers this excellent guidebook on living with attentiveness, meditation, and full-tilt compassion.<p> Part of what makes this book so accessible is Kornfield's use of everyday metaphors to describe the elusive lessons of spiritual transformation. For example, he opens with "the one seat" lesson taught to him by his esteemed teacher. Literally it means sitting in the center of a room and not being swayed or moved by all the people and dramas happening around you. On a spiritual level it means sticking "with one practice and teacher among all of the possibilities," writes Kornfield; "inwardly it means having the determination to stick with that practice through whatever difficulties and doubts arise until you have come to true clarity and understanding." The same could be said for this "one book." Among all the spiritual self-help books, this is a classic worth sticking with and returning to--a highly approachable teacher that can only lead to greater clarity and understanding. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>When Jack Kornfield's A Path with Heart was first published, it was acclaimed as the most significant book yet about American Buddhism, one "destined to become a classic". With sales approaching 200,000 copies, it has established itself as a definitive guide to the practice of traditional mindfulness in America today.<p>On this audio edition, Jack Kornfield shares the key principles of Buddhism's cherished vipassana (insight) tradition and puts them into direct service, with the unique needs of the contemporary seeker in mind. Kornfield summons his experience as a monk, psychotherapist, and meditation teacher to craft an elegant approach to integrating modern life into a full spiritual practice. The challenges unique to our times -- including our bodies, careers, relationships, ecology, education, and more -- are all embraced by this complete vision for cultivating the skills we need in order to see the preciousness in all life. Complete with many special meditations and other practices -- allshared in the clear and friendly voice that has made Kornfield a legendary teacher -- A Path with Heart leads to the healing, compassion, and freedom that arise only when we open deeply to the world around us.</p></p><h2>On the Plane (A Shine-A-Light Book )</h2><p>What can you spot at the airport today?

He went to Sandhurst in 1933 at the age of eighteen and was commissioned into the 4th Gurkha Rifles in time to take part in some of the last campaigns on the turbulent north-west frontier of India. John Masters joined a Gurhka regiment on receiving his commission, and his depiction of garrison life and campaigning on the North-West Frontier has never been surpassed. BUGLES AND A TIGER is a matchless evocation of the British Army in India on the eve of the Second World War. Still very much the army depicted by Kipling, it stands on the threshold of a war that will transform the world. This book is the first of three volumes of autobiography that touched a chord in the post-war world.</p><p>John Masters was commissioned into the Gurkha Rifles on the eve of the Second World War and rose to command one of the Chindit columns fighting behind the lines against the Japanese in Burma. He left the Army after the war to pursue a very profitable career as a novelist.</p><h2>Many Waters (The Time Quartet)</h2><p>A touch of computer keys, a blast of heat, and suddenly the Murry twins, Sandy and Dennys, are gasping in a shimmering desert land.</p><p>We've all done it. In the frigid depths of winter we've wished we could be magically transported to someplace warm and sunny. But most people don't have genius parents who just happen to be working on a scientific experiment with time travel at the moment of our wish. Sandy and Dennys Murry, the "normal" boys in a family of geniuses, suddenly find themselves trudging through a blazing-hot desert, seeking a far-off oasis for shade. Their desperate wandering brings them face-to-face with history--biblical history. Soon they're feeling right at home with Noah and his family. Even so, the urgent question is, how will Sandy and Dennys get back to their own place and time before the floods--the many waters--come? As they begin to cross the invisible border into adulthood, the twins must confront their ability to resist temptation and embrace integrity. <p> In <i>Many Waters</i>, Madeleine L'Engle continues the Murry family saga, which includes <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>; <i>A Wind in the Door</i>; and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i>, which won the American Book Award. L'Engle's mystical mix of science fiction and fantasy, time and space travel, history, morals, religion, and culture once again urges her many adoring readers to stretch their minds and hearts to understand why the world is the way it is.

There's a strange-and very small-person approaching, with a miniature mammoth in tow. . . .</p><p></p><p>At last it's Sandy and Dennys's turn for an adventure-an adventure that turns serious when they discover that "many waters" are coming to flood the desert.

The big beast between his legs throbbed with power as he roared along the narrow winding road, the wind in his hair, leaning his body into the curves with the beast so they were one, animal and machine. No other motorcycle in the world sounded like a Harley, with that deep, coughing rumble that vibrated through his entire body. Riding a motorcycle always gave him a hard-on, and his own visceral reaction to the speed and power never failed to amuse him.<br><br>Danger was sexy. Every warrior knew it, though it wasn't something people were going to read about in their Sunday newspaper magazines. His brother Josh freely admitted that landing a fighter on a carrier deck had always turned him on. "It falls just short of orgasm," was the way Josh put it. Joe, who could fly any jet built, refrained from commenting but always smiled a slow, knowing smile.<br><br>As for both Zane and himself, Chance knew there were times when each had emerged from certain tense situations, usually involving bullets, wanting nothing more than to have a woman beneath him. Chance's sexual need was ferocious at those times; his body was flooded with adrenaline and testosterone, he was <em>alive,</em> and he desperately needed a woman's soft body in which he could bury himself and release all the tension. Unfortunately, that need always had to wait: wait until he was in a secure position, maybe even in a different country entirely; wait until there was an available, willing woman at hand; and, most of all, wait until he had settled down enough that he could be relatively civilized in the sack.<br><br>But for now, there was only the Harley and himself, the rush of sweet mountain air on his face and the inner mixture of joy and fear of going home. If Mom saw him riding the Harley without a helmet she would tear a strip off his hide, which was why he had the helmet with him, securely fastened behind the seat. He would put it on before sedately riding up the mountain to visit them. Dad wouldn't be fooled, but neither would he say anything, because Wolf Mackenzie knew what it was to fly high and wild.<br><br>He crested a ridge, and Zane's house came into view in the broad valley below. The house was large, with five bedrooms and four baths, but not ostentatious; Zane had instinctively built the house so it wouldn't attract undue attention. It didn't look as large as it was, because some of the rooms were underground. He had also built it to be as secure as possible, positioning it so he had an unrestricted view in all directions, but using natural formations of the land to block land access by all but the one road. The doors were steel, with state-of-the-art locks; the windows were shatterproof, and had cost a small fortune. Strategic walls had interior armor, and an emergency generator was installed in the basement. The basement also concealed another means of escape, if escape became necessary. Motion sensors were installed around the house, and as Chance wheeled the motorcycle into the driveway, he knew his arrival had already been signaled.<br><br>Zane didn't keep his family locked in a prison, but the security provisions were there if needed. Given their jobs, prudence demanded caution, and Zane had always prepared for emergencies, always had a backup plan.<br><br>Chance cut off the motor and sat for a minute, letting his senses return to normal while he ran a hand through his windswept hair. Then he kicked the stand down and leaned the Harley onto it, and dismounted much the way he would a horse. Taking a thin file from the storage compartment, he went up on the wide, shady porch.<br><br>It was a warm summer day, mid-August, and the sky was a cloudless clear blue. Horses grazed contentedly in the pasture, though a few of the more curious had come to the fence to watch with huge, liquid dark eyes as the noisy machine roared into the driveway. Bees buzzed around Barrie's flowers, and birds sang continuously in the trees. Wyoming. Home. It wasn't far away, Mackenzie's Mountain, with the sprawling house on the mountaintop where he had been given...life and everything else in this world that was important to him.<br><br>"The door's open." Zane's low, calm voice issued from the intercom beside the door. "I'm in the office."<br><br>Chance opened the door and went inside, his booted feet silent as he walked down the hall to Zane's office. With small clicks, the door locks automatically engaged behind him. The house was quiet, meaning Barrie and the kids weren't at home; if Nick was anywhere in the house she would have run squealing to him, hurling herself into his arms, chattering nonstop in her mangled English while holding his face clasped between both her little hands, making certain his attention didn't wander from her&#x2014;as if he would dare look away. Nick was like a tiny package of unstable explosives; it was best to keep a weather eye on her.<br><br></p><h2>Masks of God: Primitive Mythology</h2><p>This volume explores the whole inner story of modern culture since the Dark Ages, treating modern man&#39;s unique position as the creator of his own mythology.</p><p>Joseph Campbell was interested in mythology since his childhood in New York, when he read books about American Indians, frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History, and was fascinated by the museum's collection of totem poles.

He lives with his family near Kansas City, MO.from the Introduction<br><br>So, what is schmoozing? According to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, schmoozing is a Yiddish word that means "to chat" or "to converse idly." In his book, The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten defines schmooze as: "Shmooze (shmooz, shmoos, shmues) Hebrew: shmuos (originally) 'things heard'; (in time) 'rumors,' 'idle talk.' Both verb and noun, shmooz means a friendly, gossipy, prolonged, heart-to-heart talk, or friendly, persuasive conversation. 'They had a little shmooz and settled everything.'" <br><br>But today there is a common misconception about the meaning of schmooze. For many people, the word has come to suggest a con or trickery, particularly a dishonest technique for "getting as much as you can out of someone without his or her permission or knowledge." It has become synonymous with pulling the wool over a person's eyes. A schmoozer is thought of as a shallow person who makes an ingratiating comment to one's face and says the opposite thing behind one's back. This couldn't be further from the truth! That's not a schmoozer, that's a small-time, no-talent, boot-lickin' scammer.<br><br>Don't make the mistake of believing that schmoozing is crass manipulation. It's not. As this book will illustrate, schmoozing is based on age-old principles: Know Thyself; The world is as you see it; As ye sow, so shall ye reap; Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Unfortunately, we now live in a world where many do unto others and then they move out of town. But it doesn't have to be that way.<br><br>Schmoozing is the Golden Rule at full throttle. It's a skill and an art form that encourages people to say, "you've made my day" instead of demanding "make my day." It's a technique for turning others on, not taking others on. A schmoozer is more than a common smooth-talker, he's a "schmooze-talker." A schmoozer is someone who talks to people as if they really mattered--and to her they do....<br><br>After all is said and done, all I want to prove is that schmoozers are never losers, and losers are never schmoozers. Listen, schmoozing has taken me around the world five times. (I'm not rich; I was working!) I've met eight Presidents, the Queen of England, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. I've worked with glamorous celebrities and the top comics and clowns in the world. I even had my own top-rated kids TV show for six years. <br><br>I can't guarantee you'll meet royalty. But as a genuine schmoozer, you might be rewarded with upgraded airline seats, better restaurant service, and a room with a view at hotels. You'll instinctively know the methods you can use with the people you deal with every day...your boss, your spouse, your kids and the next service person you encounter. <br><br>So if you're ready, I'll show you the importance of maintaining a bright outlook no matter what the weather, the way to open the door to a more enjoyable life and how to make any conversation go both smoothly and "schmoozly." To help you out, I humbly recommend you read this book with a highlighter or pencil nearby so your can mark off the things that you are willing to try and that will work for you.<br><br>If you already have a successful schmoozing style, great! When you read this book, you'll see yourself in action, and you might even gain a new idea or two. If you know of anyone who could use a few more of your skills--since a little charm does no harm--then give this book to them with a pat on the back and these words of encouragement, "I know you don't need this, but give it a read and give it to someone you know." And if you're a competent schmoozer, you won't find it back on your desk the next day.<br><br>What you are about to read is how I've tried to live my life. I've spent three fourths of my life as a functional illiterate, and schmoozing helped me get through that. As I was making it, I was faking it. But at the end of the day, I was sincere. I truly love people and believe that we're all in this together. I volunteer whenever possible, give what I can afford and really believe that schmoozers are more givers than takers. I hope this book will make your life easier and friendlier. Fantasize that if it catches on, we can achieve world peace. So, my advice is take a vacation, whatever you think is first-class, once a year, every year. Do the right thing. Brush and floss. And remember, yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, today's a gift-that's why they call it present.<br> <br></p><h2>The Sesame Street Songbook: 64 Favorite Songs</h2><p>Featuring Jim Henson&#39;s Sesame Street Muppets, arranged by the original Sesame Street songwriters.

Its earlier history is best seen on the Castle Hill of Buda, the seat of Hungarian royal power since the beginning in the 13th Century. This peaked in the glory years of King Matthias' reign in the second half of the 15th Century, when Buda was one of the largest and wealthiest cities of Europe. The Ottoman conquest that followed a generation later was a catastrophe whose effect would last two centuries. However when the new Castle Hill of Buda arose, it became a version of Baroque central Europe, controlled by Imperial Vienna. Pest, on the opposite banks of the Danube, is a symbol of the grandeur of the late 19th Century metropolis. Elaborate, historicist buildings and monuments first inhabited by the members of the rising bourgeoisie that had achieved prosperity in the booming Budapest around the year 1900. This era still largely defines the visual appearance of the central city. Nearly half a century later Fascism, and then forty years of Communism, again produced economic dislocation and social tumult in the lives of the people. This is best shown through descriptions of the fate of individual families in Budapest. Since 1990 the metropolis and its people have gone through a frenzied transition for which there was no template: authoritarian socialist economy to volatile capitalism and democracy. The story of the key players and groups in this transition make this tumultuous process particularly vivid. Today Budapest is a city whose role in Europe is still being crystallized. However inventive entrepreneurs and creative artists are making the city a more and more vibrant home for its citizens and a favoured destination for a rapidly increasing flow of visitors.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Joe Hajdu is a cultural geographer.

She has kept vigil alongside Chris&#x2019;s wife, Kitty, who has also been mourning the death of their first child. However, when Chris returns to their isolated estate outside of London, he is a man transformed, suffering from shell shock and believing he is still twenty years old. He is baffled by his surroundings, which have somehow aged beyond his memory, and he&#x2019;s hopelessly, obsessively in love with a woman. Except&#x2014;the woman he&#x2019;s in love with is not his wife. He doesn&#x2019;t even remember her, or the son they lost. Instead, he declares his undying love for Margaret, a poor innkeeper&#x2019;s daughter with whom he shared a passionate summer romance fifteen years prior.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rebecca West published her often-overlooked debut novel at the age of only twenty-six during the height of World War I, and was one of the first writers to explore the impact of posttraumatic stress in literature. The result is a tense, gripping portrait of sacrifice, regret, and the transformative power of war to alter our understanding of ourselves.</p><p>It would be a crime to give away even the barest outline of Rebecca West's apparently simple, always agonizing first novel. We shall say only that <i>The Return of the Soldier</i> concerns the title character and three very different women to whom he is linked in very different ways--by blood, by marriage, and by love. It is also an imaginative study (one drenched in realism) of intimacy and illusion, possession and a terrible, destructive snobbery. On one estate outside London, even as the Great War and familial loss are taking their toll, the inhabitants strive for a measured, outwardly exquisite existence. All must remain as it was while their Chris is at war: each person, each object in its proper place. "You probably know the beauty of that view," the narrator buttonholes us, looking out the nursery window: <blockquote> For when Chris rebuilt Baldry Court after his marriage, he handed it over to architects who had not so much the wild eye of the artist as the knowing wink of the manicurist, and between them they massaged the dear old place into matter for innumerable photos in the illustrated papers. </blockquote> But of late this universe unto itself cannot quite keep out an England altered by ambition and industry. Only a few miles away a "red suburban stain," Wealdstone, has somehow cropped up. And one day all is permanently altered--or, rather, revealed--when a Wealdstone resident comes bearing news of Captain Baldry. Mrs. William Gray is clearly not of Chris's wife Kitty and his cousin Jenny's class, as Kitty in particular makes her aware. "Again her gray eyes brimmed," Jenny observes. "People are rude to one, she visibly said, but surely not nice people like this." How is it, then, that this dreary, "dingy" woman knows Chris and knows that something has happened to him? And how is it that Jenny soon comes to see her as someone "whose personality was sounding through her squalor like a beautiful voice singing in a darkened room"?<p> In the remainder of this brief, perfect novel, a vanished (or repressed) past and its lost prospect of happiness comes to the fore. Rebecca West is best remembered for <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia</i> (1941), but she displays the same vision--and a similar degree of realism--in her charged 1916 novel. Many readers will passionately regret the book's last twist, even as they know it to be artistically as well as historically true. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Set during World War I on an isolated country estate just outside London, Rebecca West&#x2019;s haunting novel <b>The Return of the Soldier</b> follows Chris Baldry, a shell-shocked captain suffering from amnesia, as he makes a bittersweet homecoming to the three women who have helped shape his life. Will the devoted wife he can no longer recollect, the favorite cousin he remembers only as a childhood friend, and the poor innkeeper&#x2019;s daughter he once courted leave Chris to languish in a safe, dreamy past&#x2014;or will they help him recover his memory so that he can return to the front?

One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.</b><b><br></b><b>"A more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell." --<i>New York Times</i></b><br>After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way-and in some places it isn't.<br><br>Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014. A quarter of a million views later, the subject of that video is being seriously considered by leading economists and government leaders the world over. It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today.<br><br><i>Utopia for Realists </i>is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. <br><br>Every progressive milestone of civilization-from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy-was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world.<b><br><br></b></p><p><b>Rutger Bregman</b> is a journalist at <i>The Correspondent</i>, and one of Europe's most prominent young thinkers.

At Skï¿½rtoft, there is a belief in organic, small-scale-produced whole grains, traditional stone-ground milling techniques, use of wild fermented sourdough, organic yeast, and attention to terroir. Their farm produces some of the highest-quality, nutrient-rich grain available. In fact, Copenhagen's celebrated restaurant NOMA, recently accorded a "World's Best Restaurant" award, uses Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle products. Indeed, the growing movement of Nordic cuisine centers on its devotion to high-quality regional produce, the creativity of the chef, and a sound awareness of the workings of nature. This set of principles also serves to guide Hanne Risgaard in <em>Home Baked</em>.</p> <p>Risgaard offers practical information not only on the concepts and processes behind creating delicious Scandinavian breads, but also concise growing and cultivation information about the grains themselves, as well as a guide to basic equipment and kitchen set-up, ingredients, and the history of Skï¿½rtoft and their philosophy. At the beginning of each recipe there is a brief story contextualizing where the recipe comes from. Their world comes alive!</p> <p><em>Home Baked</em> includes detailed sections on: baking with yeast; sourdoughs; baking without a raising agent (pies, cakes, cookies, crackers); and covers grains such as wheat, spelt, barley, and rye. The breads include unique ingredients like foraged herbs and greens, such as the Cocotte with Ramsons (either put directly in the bread dough or preserved in a syrup of pearls of rye and sea buckthorn berries); as well as other interesting standouts like the Buns for Tilters (with apple and yogurt, prepared for the annual horse games), Green Knots (made with stinging nettle, in honor of the fight to save the nettle in France), Rosemary Sourdough, Elderflower Muffins, and more.Perfectly timed for the growing interest in Scandinavian, and particularly Danish, cuisine, <em>Home Baked</em> is a must-have for the bread lover's library.</p></p><p><p>Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle-literally translated as "Cut-Road Mill"-is situated on Als, an idyllic island in the southeast of Denmark, and has been in the Bonde family since 1892.&nbsp; Als is situated in the Baltic Sea, some 30km from the German-Danish border, and was formerly a part of the German Grand Duchy of Schleswig. Because of its history of changing ownership between the two countries, both Danes and Germans continue to feel at home in the area.</p> <p>In 1991, the decision was taken to run Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle as a solely organic enterprise, and Hanne and Jï¿½rgen continue to oversee all of its endeavors with love, care, and attention.</p> <p>Besides flour, Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle produces grains known as "pearls": as in pearl spelt, pearl rye, and pearl barley. They select whole grains of spelt, rye, and barley, and then polish them, removing the woody outer husk to make "pearls." These were a staple food of older times, providing a solid, healthy diet to folk throughout Scandinavia and northern Europe. The New Nordic Cuisine combines health, well-being, and enjoyment with the best of modern gastronomy-and the renaissance of the pearls is proving to have a vital role in this. Copenhagen's celebrated NOMA, which recently received a "World's Best Restaurant" award, uses Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle products.</p> <p>Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle is run by author Hanne Risgaard, her husband Jï¿½rgen Bonde, and her daughter, Marie-Louise, who is the translator of <em>Home Baked: Nordic Recipes and Techniques for Organic Bread and Pastry</em>. Hanne Risgaard and Jï¿½rgen took over a previous farming operation in 1983 and converted to entirely organic in 1991. In 2004 they decided to turn their empty buildings into a mill and start producing their own organic, stone-ground flour. Since then, the family-run company has produced a steadily growing range of prize-winning products that both stimulate the senses and follow modern culinary trends. In 2006, Marie-Louise joined her parents full-time in product development, marketing, and management of the farm and mill. She is also an agronomist specializing in organic agriculture and is a fifth-generation farmer of Skï¿½rtoft.</p><p><em><strong>ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>"Nordic baking may not be part of the household cookbook section, but it ought to be. In this new book, Hanne Risgaard introduces American bakers to the joys and intricacies of baking with organic grains. Taking a cue from an Old Danish proverb quoted in the book, &#x201c;&#x2018;If only it had been a grain of barley,&#x2019; sighed the hungry hen, when she found a diamond in the dung-pile,&#x201d; this book is about nurturing that which sustains the body and soul. Readers learn about baking, grain, and Danish culture in this warm and inviting book.</p><br><br><p>Co-owner and operator of Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle, a working stone mill, Risgaard is intimately familiar with multiple grains, their properties, and the ways in which those properties translate into different tastes, textures, and color in baked goods. She began her career in media but after forty years in that business, she turned her attention to farming, and eventually organic farming. The Skï¿½rtoft Stable Kitchen at Skï¿½rtoft started offering bread baking classes in 2008, and in 2011, <em>Home Baked</em> was nominated for Best Bread Book of the Year at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards.</p><br><br><p>The book begins with a foreword by Jeffrey Hamelman, the director of the Baking and Education Center at the King Arthur Flour Company in Norwich, Vermont. He reveals an initial apprehension about making an outstanding baking book for the home baker, but is soon relieved by Risgaard&#x2019;s &#x201c;clear and abiding concern and commitment for human health.&#x201d; In addition to her discussion of the benefits of organic grains, she also gives the reader an appreciation for the Nordic landscape and palette.</p><br><br><p>American bakers will find lovely photographs and unique ingredients throughout the book, such as lavender, spelt, cardamom, elderflower, and more. They will also find that all of the measurements are given in grams. This may initially be off-putting for those accustomed to measuring cups and spoons, but Risgaard defends her choice, noting that baking, like chemistry, requires very specific measurement and a scale gives the necessary specificity for at- home success. She also gives very specific, well- illustrated instruction on kneading techniques</p><br><br><p>After the foreword, the author gives her own introduction of her life and work at&nbsp;Skï¿½rtoft Mï¿½lle, then she launches into an introduction to the equipment, ingredients, and basic tenets of bread baking. She offers recipes with yeast, sourdoughs, and other starters before expanding into other baking with baking powder and without a rising agent. Recipes include Pear and Sourdough Bread, Buns for Tilters, Fredericksg&#x1fb;rd Lunch Bread as well as Hanne&#x2019;s Lemon Pie, Fritters with Herbs, Chou with Cheese, and Elderflower Muffins with Mascarpone. The final section of the book features leftovers, a thoughtful addition for families trying to stretch a dollar or be attentive to their environmental impact.</p><br><br><p>This is an easy to follow, surprising, and inspiring baking book. Risgaard&#x2019;s joy in sharing her craft is contagious and home cooks will find themselves headed to the kitchen for the both warmth this book promises and that the recipes deliver."--Camille-Yvette Welsch</p><br><br><p>"Many books capture the romance of baking, while others convey the nuts and bolts--but rarely does one book hit both chords at the same time. With <em>Home Baked</em>, Hanne Risgaard has written a practical, beautiful, and, most importantly, inspiring bread book for the ages. Every page, every recipe, makes me want to gather the grain with my own hands and transform it into earthy, delicious, and gorgeous loaves of bread."<strong>--Peter Reinhart, author of <em>Whole Grain Breads</em> and <em>Artisan Breads Everyday</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"When I first became a baker, I made a career-changing visit to an organic wheatfield and mill. As a baker I thought I knew flour, but it wasn't until I stood in a wheatfield that I realized that my passion for bread was part of a larger story. <em>Home Baked</em> is a testament to the craft that I have enjoyed since 1983. Refreshingly told from the perspective of the miller, the recipes are true to their Nordic origins and never step too far away from the fields on which the grain is grown."<strong>--Daniel Leader, author of <em>Bread Alone</em> and <em>Local Breads</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Hanne Risgaard's connection to and understanding of the grains grown and milled on her land at Skaertoft shines through in this beautiful collection of Nordic recipes, drawn from the rich baking heritage of northern Europe. <em>Home Baked</em> is atmospheric and appealing!"<strong>--Richard Bertinet, author of <em>Dough: Simple Contemporary Breads</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Home Baked is an absolute treasure! Plus, its timing couldn't be better with more people (myself included) exploring flours other than modern commercial wheat. I think people will like cooking by weight rather than volume-it will do so much to insure success in making Hanne Risgaard's straight forward, mouthwatering, and very promising recipes.<strong>--Deborah Madison, author of <em>Local Flavors</em></strong></p></p><h2>Triumphs of Experience: The Men of the Harvard Grant Study</h2><p><p>At a time when many people around the world are living into their tenth decade, the longest longitudinal study of human development ever undertaken offers some welcome news for the new old age: our lives continue to evolve in our later years, and often become more fulfilling than before.</p><p>Begun in 1938, the Grant Study of Adult Development charted the physical and emotional health of over 200 men, starting with their undergraduate days. The now-classic <i>Adaptation to Life</i> reported on the men&#x2019;s lives up to age 55 and helped us understand adult maturation. Now George Vaillant follows the men into their nineties, documenting for the first time what it is like to flourish far beyond conventional retirement.</p><p>Reporting on all aspects of male life, including relationships, politics and religion, coping strategies, and alcohol use (its abuse being by far the greatest disruptor of health and happiness for the study&#x2019;s subjects), <i>Triumphs of Experience</i> shares a number of surprising findings. For example, the people who do well in old age did not necessarily do so well in midlife, and vice versa. While the study confirms that recovery from a lousy childhood is possible, memories of a happy childhood are a lifelong source of strength. Marriages bring much more contentment after age 70, and physical aging after 80 is determined less by heredity than by habits formed prior to age 50. The credit for growing old with grace and vitality, it seems, goes more to ourselves than to our stellar genetic makeup.</p></p><p>George E. Vaillant is Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.George Vaillant tells the story of the Grant Study men though age 91. This is, arguably, the most important study of the life course ever done. But it is, inarguably, the one most brimming with wisdom. If you are preparing for the last quarter of your life, this is a MUST read. (Martin Seligman, author of <i>Authentic Happiness</i>)<br><br>Vaillant's fascination with the human condition and his deep insights about development make him a great storyteller, adept at elegantly conveying the essence of humanity. (Laura L. Carstensen, Director, Stanford Center on Longevity)<br><br>A fascinating account of the 268 individuals selected for the Harvard Study of Adult Development... Vaillant has done a wonderful job summarizing the study, discussing its major findings, and communicating his enthusiasm for every aspect of the project, which became his life's work starting in 1966. The study has been investigating what makes a successful and healthy life. Initially, this meant looking for potential officer material for the military. Vaillant established what he called 'the Decathlon of Flourishing&#x2015;a set of ten accomplishments in late life that covered many different facets of success.' With humor and intriguing insights, the author shows how progress in health studies and the passage of time contributed to the constant 'back and forth between nature and nurture.' During Vaillant's tenure, human maturation and resilience became the focus, and now biology is reasserting itself in the form of DNA studies and fMRI imaging, the seeds for future research. The author considers the study's greatest contributions to be a demonstration that human growth continues long after adolescence, the world's longest and most thorough study of alcoholism, and its identification and charting of involuntary coping mechanisms. Inspiring when reporting these successes, his personal approach to discovery repeatedly draws readers in as he leads up to the account of his realization that the true value of a human life can only be fully understood in terms of the cumulative record of the entire life span. Joyful reading about a groundbreaking study and its participants. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i> 2012-09-01)<br><br>Of the 31 men in the study incapable of establishing intimate bonds, only four are still alive. Of those who were better at forming relationships, more than a third are living. It's not that the men who flourished had perfect childhoods. Rather, as <b>Vaillant</b> puts it, 'What goes right is more important than what goes wrong.' The positive effect of one loving relative, mentor or friend can overwhelm the negative effects of the bad things that happen. In case after case, the magic formula is capacity for intimacy combined with persistence, discipline, order and dependability. The men who could be affectionate about people and organized about things had very enjoyable lives. But a childhood does not totally determine a life. The beauty of the Grant Study is that, as Vaillant emphasizes, it has followed its subjects for nine decades. The big finding is that you can teach an old dog new tricks. The men kept changing all the way through, even in their 80s and 90s. (David Brooks <i>New York Times</i> 2012-11-05)<br><br><b>Vaillant</b> concludes that personal development need never stop, no matter how old you are. At an advanced age, though, growth consists more in finding new hues and shades in one's past than in conceiving plans for the future. As the Harvard Study shows with such poignancy, older men treat what lies behind them much as younger men treat what lies ahead. The future is what young men dream about; they ponder the extent to which it is predetermined or open; and they try to shape it. For old men, it is the past they dream about; it is the past whose inevitability or indeterminateness they attempt to measure; and it is the past they try to reshape. For the most regret-free men in the Harvard study, the past is the work of their future. (Andrew Stark <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2012-11-02)<br><br>To avid consumers of modern happiness literature, some of <b>Vaillant</b>'s conclusions will seem shopworn ('Happiness is love. Full stop.'), while other results of the Grant Study appear to confirm what social science has long posited--that a warm and stable childhood environment is a crucial ingredient of success; or that alcoholism is a strong predictor of divorce. But what's unique about the Grant Study is the freedom it gives Vaillant to look past quick diagnosis, to focus on how patterns of growth can determine patterns of wellbeing. Life is long, Vaillant seems to be saying, and lots of shit happens. What is true in one stage of a man's life is not true in another. Previously divorced men are capable of long and loving marriages. There is a time to monitor cholesterol (before age 50) and a time to ignore it. Self-starting, as a character trait, is relatively unimportant to flourishing early in life but very important at the end of it. Socially anxious men struggle for decades in emotional isolation and then mature past it--relatively speaking. <i>Triumphs of Experience</i> is not only a history of how the Grant men adapted (or not) to life over 70-plus years, but of how author and science grew up alongside them. Yet what unifies <i>Triumphs</i> is the same question posed originally by Bock, the study's founder: What factors meaningfully and reliably predict the good life? Vaillant's mission is to uncover the 'antecedents of flourishing.' (Dan Slater <i>Daily Beast</i> 2012-11-07)<br><br><b>George Vaillant</b>'s book on the development and well-being of a longitudinal sample of men, now in their nineties and studied regularly since they were undergraduates at Harvard University, <i>reads </i>like a riveting detective tale... He has a thought-provoking story to tell about the lifelong significance of loving care...Brief life-story vignettes illustrate movingly how adult development and maturation is a lifelong process that strongly relates to the transformative power of receiving and giving love... [The book's] well-evidenced wisdoms on the significance of nurturing relationships offer new multidisciplinary perspectives on the complex issue of nature versus nurture (much needed at a time when medical science and genetics once more dominate studies of human development) and on the lifelong costs of childhood emotional neglect.

Stina Lyon <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2012-12-13)<br><br><i>Triumphs of Experience </i>elegantly summarizes the findings of this vast longitudinal study, unique in the annals of research...[The] book analyzes how the men fared over their late adulthood, and indeed their entire lives. In it, <b>Vaillant</b> masterfully chronicles how their life successes, or lack thereof, correlate with the nature of their childhoods, marriages, mental health, physical health, substance abuse, and attitudes. Extensive quantitative findings are interspersed with the detailed stories of individual study participants...Here Vaillant proves that his skills are literary as well as scientific. The case histories are engaging novelistic capsules that artfully bring the quantitative material to life...Many of its findings seem universal. If they could be boiled down to a single revelation, it would be that the secret to a happy life is relationships, relationships, relationships...The other overarching message of this book is that resilience counts...Vaillant is that rare thing: a psychiatrist more interested in mental flourishing than in mental illness. With <i>Triumphs of Experience</i>, he has turned the Harvard men's disparate stories into a single narrative and created a field guide, both practical and profound, to how to lead a good life. (Charles Barber <i>Wilson Quarterly</i> 2013-01-01)<br><br>In <i>Triumphs of Experience</i>, <b>Vaillant</b> elegantly and persuasively brings us an answer to the question that launched a thousand snake-oil salesmen: what makes for a successful and happy life? ...[An] engaging work.

(Christopher Croke <i>The Australian</i> 2013-02-09)<br><br>Reading like a storybook, the case histories of the individuals provide fascinating insights about how the subjects tackled challenges or succumbed to setbacks. <b>Vaillant</b> superbly explains how these lifelong experiences sculpted these men's final years.

Published here in its entirety is the third edition of 1872 for which Newman added an additional sermon, bracketed notes, and, importantly, a comprehensive, condensed Preface. In her introduction, noted Newman scholar Mary Katherine Tillman considers the volume as an integral whole, showing how all of the sermons systematically relate to the central theme of the faith-reason relationship.</p><p>John Henry Cardinal Newman (1801-1890) was an Anglican priest, poet and theologian and later a Catholic cardinal, who was an important and controversial figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century.&#x201c;Because faith restores all things natural, it gives the intellectual back his intellect.

More than a collection of thoughts for the day, <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> offers a progressive program of spiritual study, leading the reader through essential concepts, themes, and practices on the Buddhist path.<br> <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> does not assume prior knowledge of Buddhist thought or practice, making it a perfect introduction to Pema Chï¿½drï¿½n&#x2019;s teachings on lovingkindness, meditation, mindfulness, &#x201c;nowness,&#x201d; letting go, and working with fear and other painful emotions. Through the course of this book, readers will learn practical methods for heightening awareness and overcoming habitual patterns that block compassion.</p><p><i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> reads like a perfect companion guide to the traditional 108-day Buddhist retreat. In a day-by-day format, author Pema Chï¿½drï¿½n dives into the soothing wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism, reminding us that groundlessness is the only ground we have to stand on. Each of her 108 teachings are brief (about two pages), and all of them are excerpted from longer discussions in Chï¿½drï¿½n's previous bestselling books (<i>The Places That Scare You</i> and <i>When Things Fall Apart</i>). Nonetheless, newcomers as well as seasoned fans of Chï¿½drï¿½n's writing will glean much from this training program for becoming a "warrior bodhisattva"--a term which, simply put, means one who aspires to act from an awakened heart.<p>Gradually, Chï¿½drï¿½n guides readers beyond the tunnel vision of the self, expanding outward to include compassion for all of humanity. In the 12th teaching, "The Root of Suffering," Chï¿½drï¿½n writes: "What keeps us unhappy and stuck in a limited view of reality is our tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain, to seek security and avoid groundlessness, to seek comfort and avoid discomfort." In the 77th teaching, "Cool Loneliness," she suggests that the next time readers wake up in the morning feeling the "heartache of alienation" they try to "relax and touch the limitless space of the human heart." By the 101st teaching, Chï¿½drï¿½n speaks to "taking refuge in the Sangha," meaning becoming warriors who are not only committed to taking off their own armors of self-pity, but are also committed to gently helping others do the same. Student warriors will also appreciate the glossary, bibliography, and resource guide in the back. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Chodron, a Buddhist nun, teaches the philosophy that she shares with studentsin her workshops, seminars, and meditation retreats around the world.3 CDs.</p><h2>Rebecca/Jamaica Inn/Frenchman&#39;s Creek/My Cousin Rachel</h2><p>Four complete and unabridged books by Daphne DuMaurier published separately now combined in one volume.

This is one life story you'll never forget: a kid actor in New york on radio plays...popularizing "women in pants" at Evan-Picone...being discovered poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel by Norma Shearer...becoming the first actor to ever run a motion picture studio...reviving the moribund Paramount Pictures...overseeing production of Love Story, The Godfather, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, The Odd Couple...marriage to golden girl Ali McGraw and birth of son Joshua...long friendships with Nicholson, Beatty, and Hoffman....disgrace and drugs...the Cotton Club scandal...self-commitment and escape from a mental institution...and an eventual triumphant return to the catbird seat. An extraordinary raconteur, Evans spares no one least of all himself, on this legendary no-holds-barred Hollywood journey.</p></p><p>The Kid Stays in the Picture is now a major motion picture. Adapted from this autobiography, the documentary is narrated by Mr. Evans in his distinctive voice and trademark staccato delivery. This incredible story is brought to life using visual effects, archival footage, clips from classic films and 35mm photography. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and is scheduled for nationwide release in summer 2002. This legendary autobiography is guaranteed to become on of the most talked about books of the year.<p>Robert Evans's <em>The Kid Stays in the Picture</em> is universally recognized as the greatest, most outrageous, most unforgettable show business memoir ever written. The basis of a groundbreaking, award-winning documentary film, it remains the gold standard of Hollywood storytelling.</p><p>The only actor ever to run a Hollywood studio, Evans emerged from near-obscurity in the mid-1960s to rescue Paramount, one of the great studios of the Golden Age, from near-bankruptcy. A self-confessed "half-assed actor," Evans proved a genius producer and studio chief, drawing on his irresistible combination of instinct, smarts, showmanship, and bravado to take Paramount from the basement to the penthouse with such films as <em>The Odd Couple</em>, <em>Rosemary's Baby</em>, <em>Love Story</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, and <em>Chinatown</em>. He lived a swashbuckling life, partying with lifetime friends like Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Dustin Hoffman, consulting with power players like Henry Kissinger, and squiring a host of dazzling women including his wives Ali McGraw, Catherine Oxenberg, and Phyllis George. After a decade of triumph, he lost everything in a spectacular flameout of cocaine and bad business decisions, yet survived it all&#x2014;and lived to tell the tale.</p><p>An extraordinary raconteur, Evans spares no one, least of all himself. Filled with starring roles for everyone from Ava Gardner to Marlon Brando to Sharon Stone, <em>The Kid Stays in the Picture</em> is sharp, witty, and self-aggrandizing and self-lacerating in equal measure. </p><p>This new It Books edition, the first in more than a decade, will feature a new foreword by the author. And simultaneous with this edition will come a first-ever ebook rollout&#x2014;including both a regular edition and an enhanced ebook with clips from Evans's celebrated, Grammy-nominated audiobook and the famous 2002 documentary.</p></p><h2>Vegas Heat</h2><p>Unhappily married to the jealous, domineering Simon, Fanny Thornton finds herself estranged from her four children by Simon&#39;s obsessive paranoia about her ex-husband, Ash, but with Babylon, the family&#39;s casino, threatened by Ash&#39;s illness, Fanny is forced to step in to save the business and reunite her family.</p><p>The year is 1980.

The expedition would prove fraught with adventure--and peril. <i>South </i>is the remarkable tale of the ill-fated expedition, told in Shackleton's own words--breathtakingly illustrated in this unique edition with photography from the expedition, modern images of the Antarctic, and newly discovered photos from the Ross Sea Party. </b><br><br> This handsome edition, first published in 2016, is presented in paperback to coincide with the <b>100th anniversary of the original publication</b> and features <b>images by expedition photographer Frank Hurley</b>, <b>modern color photography</b> of the fauna and vistas the men encountered, as well as<b> long-lost photos </b>taken by the expedition's <b>Ross Sea Party </b>and discovered in 2013.<br><br> The expedition's story begins on the eve of World War I, when the ship <i>Endurance </i>departed England with Shackleton and his team of six men. The <b>plan was to travel 1,800 miles across the icy continent</b> from the Atlantic side, while a second team aboard the <i>Aurora</i>, would reach Antarctica's Pacific side and lay out supply depots for the advancing team. As the <i>Endurance </i>approached the continent, however, it became <b>hopelessly locked in an ice floe, beginning a series of harrowing travails</b>.<br><br> Today considered an <b>adventure survival </b>classic, <i>South </i>is the true story of a thrilling polar expedition. Never before has Shackleton's lively prose been so extensively and stunningly illustrated.</p><p>Soon after the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole in 1911, his Anglo-Irish rival, Sir Ernest Shackleton, sought to top the feat by making his way from one end of Antarctica to the other on sledge. He set off with a crew of 28, including scientists and a movie cameraman, but the voyage turned disastrous when Shackleton's ship, the <i>Endurance</i>, became hopelessly stuck in pack ice, throwing the men (and the dogs brought to pull the sledges) into a desperate battle for survival. <i>South</i> is Shackleton's own account--one of the critical sources for Alfred Lansing's bestseller <i>Endurance</i>--of what it was like to be "helpless intruders in a strange world," a vivid narrative in which tales of Edwardian pluck are counterpointed with lyrical accounts of whales, penguins, and bizarre mirages. This story of a group of men who beat nearly impossible odds to escape death and make their way home is one of the all-time great survival stories. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>This is the most handsome paperback edition available of this important historic record.</p><h2>Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment: A Tragedy of Race and Medicine</h2><p>From 1932 to 1972, the United States Public Health Service conducted a non-therapeutic experiment involving over 400 black male sharecroppers infected with syphilis. The Tuskegee Study had nothing to do with treatment. It purpose was to trace the spontaneous evolution of the disease in order to learn how syphilis affected black subjects. The men were not told they had syphilis; they were not warned about what the disease might do to them; and, with the exception of a smattering of medication during the first few months, they were not given health care. Instead of the powerful drugs they required, they were given aspirin for their aches and pains. Health officials systematically deceived the men into believing they were patients in a government study of &#34;bad blood&#34;, a catch-all phrase black sharecroppers used to describe a host of illnesses. At the end of this 40 year deathwatch, more than 100 men had died from syphilis or related complications. &#34;Bad Blood&#34; provides compelling answers to the question of how such a tragedy could have been allowed to occur. Tracing the evolution of medical ethics and the nature of decision making in bureaucracies, Jones attempted to show that the Tuskegee Study was not, in fact, an aberration, but a logical outgrowth of race relations and medical practice in the United States. Now, in this revised edition of &#34;Bad Blood&#34;, Jones traces the tragic consequences of the Tuskegee Study over the last decade. A new introduction explains why the Tuskegee Study has become a symbol of black oppression and a metaphor for medical neglect, inspiring a prize-winning play, a Nova special, and a motion picture. A new concluding chapter shows how the black community&#39;s wide-spread anger and distrust caused by the Tuskegee Study has hampered efforts by health officials to combat AIDS in the black community. &#34;Bad Blood&#34; was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and was one of the &#34;N.Y. Times&#34; 12 best books of the year.</p><p></p><h2>Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind</h2><p>Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In <em>Phantoms in the Brain,</em> Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases:<ul><li>A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial. </li><li>A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be "wired" for religious experience?</li><li> A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.</li></ul><p>Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the "big questions" about consciousness and the self.</p></p><p>What would <i>you</i> say about a woman who, despite stroke-induced paralysis crippling the entire left side of her body, insists that she is whole and strong--who even sees her left hand reach out to grasp objects? Freud called it "denial"; neurologists call it "anosognosia." However it may be labeled, this phenomenon and others like it allow us peeks into other mental worlds and afford us considerable insight into our own. <p> The writings of Oliver Sacks and others have shown us that we can learn much about ourselves by looking closely at the deficits shown by people with neurological problems. V.S. Ramachandran has seen countless patients suffering from anosognosia, phantom limb pain, blindsight, and other disorders, and he brings a remarkable mixture of clinical intuition and research savvy to bear on their problems. He is one of the few scientists who are able and willing to explore the personal, subjective ramifications of his work; he rehumanizes an often too-sterile field and captures the spirit of wonder so essential for true discovery. <i>Phantoms in the Brain</i> is equal parts medical mystery, scientific adventure, and philosophical speculation; Ramachandran's writing is smart, caring, and very, very funny.</p><p> Whether you're curious about the workings of the brain, interested in alternatives to expensive, high-tech science (much of Ramachandran's research is done with materials found around the home), or simply want a fresh perspective on the nature of human consciousness, you'll find satisfaction with <i>Phantoms in the Brain</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>V.

She believes in knitting for pleasure above all else and so she has learned to skip the boring steps - for her - of purling back and sewing up seams. Her original designs - over 20 of them are given in this book - are based on circular knitting with an absolute minimum of purling and sewing. The designs - for sweaters, caps socks, mittens etc. - are not only smart and practical but can be made in any size because the directions are based on proportions rather than fixed measurements - you knit the garments to fit you, not some professional model, Instructions are clear and simple and at the same time made to sound like such fun that you can hardly wait to start knitting - the only problem is which design to choose. Mrs. Zimmermann fully understands the hesitancy of the beginner and leads her (the beginner) gently past all possible pitfalls. Moreover, not only novices but even the most experienced knitters can learn new tricks and short-cuts from this friendly and informative guide.&#34;</p><p><b>Elizabeth Zimmermann</b> (1910-1999) was born near London, England, and attended art school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, Germany, before immigrating to the U.S. in 1937. Frustrated by magazine editors who translated her conversational knitting instructions into abbreviated code, she started her own knitting newsletter and launched Schoolhouse Press, a mail-order business that still sells knitting supplies, books, and videos under her daughter Meg Swansen's guiding hand. In the mid-1960s she hosted <i>The Busy Knitter,</i> a nationally syndicated public television show, and by the early 1970s had become an icon of the knitting world. This and her three lively instructional books -- <i>Knitting Around, Knitter's Almanac,</i> and <i>Knitting Workshop</i> -- are treasured by knitters around the world.<b>Chapter 1</b> <p> <b>The Opinionated Knitter</b> </p><p> Most people have an obsession; mine is knitting. </p><p> Your hobby may be pie-baking, playing the piano, or potbelly-stove collecting, and you can sympathize with my enthusiasm, having an obsession of your own. Will you forgive my single-mindedness, and my tendency to see knitting in everything? </p><p> Carvings and sculpture remind me only of Aran and other textured designs; when I see a beautiful print my first thought is how it would adapt to color pattern knitting; confronted by a new fashion, I immediately start drawing in the air with my forefinger to see if it would suit itself to knitting, and if so, how -- which way the grain should run, if the shape could be knitted in, and what stitch would be most effective. </p><p> So please bear with me, and put up with my opinionated, nay, sometimes cantankerous attitude. I feel strongly about knitting. </p><p> What follows is an attempt to explain some of the ideas that come while designing knitted garments, and during the pleasant hours spent working on the plain straight pieces. </p><p> I am taking it for granted that you are already familiar with the rudiments of the craft. </p><p> Properly practiced, knitting soothes the troubled spirit, and it doesn't hurt the untroubled spirit either. </p><p> When I say properly practiced, I mean executed in a relaxed manner, without anxiety, strain, or tension, but with confidence, inventiveness, pleasure, and ultimate pride. </p><p> If you hate to knit, why, bless you, don't; follow your secret heart and take up something else. But if you start out knitting with enjoyment, you will probably continue in this pleasant path. </p><p> Consider the agreeable material and tools. (I admit to a rooted preference for wool.) </p><p> WOOL </p><p> Soft wool from the simple silly sheep can be as fine as a cobweb, tough and strong as string, or light and soft as down. There are scientific reasons why wool is the best material for knitting, and into these I will not go. I only know that it is warm, beautiful, and durable. Woolen socks never become cold and clammy, however wet. A woolen sweater is so water-resistant that when dropped overboard it floats long enough to give you ample time to rescue it. The surface on caps and mittens made of wool repels all but the most persistent of downpours. I have in mind a particularly beautiful cap made of the finest wool and angora at seven stitches to the inch in the lovely designs of Bohus in Sweden. It has been worn for two seasons by a dedicated ski-teacher in all manner of blizzards and dirty weather, and she swears that it is the warmest and driest hat she has -- snow perches on it but does not penetrate. </p><p> For people allergic to wool, one's heart can only bleed. Synthetics are a marvelous substitute, but a substitute is all they are. The allergic must be grateful that they didn't live in the Dark Ages of fifty years ago when one kept warm in winter with wool, or froze to death in linen and cotton. Of course, some avoided pleurisy by swathing themselves in sables. </p><p> It is true that a synthetic sweater can be washed and dried in machines, but to me this rather reduces it to the level of a sweatshirt. Washing a real sweater is akin to bathing a baby, and brings the same satisfaction of producing a clean, pretty, sweet-smelling creature -- very rewarding. </p><p> There is a persuasive old wives' tale about one reason why wool shrinks. It goes, "Never wind your wool into a tight hard ball, as this will make it stretched and taut. You knit it up into a sweater. Then it gets dirty and you wash it. The wool, encouraged by the dampness, goes back to its original unstretched state, with the result that the whole sweater shrinks." Think it over. </p><p> "Ply" is a frequently misunderstood concept. It has nothing to do with the thickness of yarn, except in a relative way, and everything to do with its construction. </p><p> A ply is a strand of wool. Two, three, four, or more strands are twisted together to make 2-ply, 3-ply, 4-ply, or many-plied wool. Since the strands or plies can be of any thickness, it is clear that the thickness of wool does not depend on the <i>number</i> of plies but on the <i>thickness</i> of the individual ply. I have used 9-ply wool which was no thicker than 4-ply knitting worsted, and I'm sure all are familiar with 2-ply wool so heavy and bulky that it knits up at 2 1/2 stitches to 1 inch. </p><p> So when buying wool be guided by the recommended GAUGE rather than by the number of plies, and compare this recommended GAUGE with the GAUGE specified in your knitting instructions. </p><p> When wondering how much wool to buy, ask the saleslady. She knows by experience. If she doesn't know and isn't interested, go to another store. In fact, start off by going to the best specialty yarn shop or good department store that you can find. It is not wise to shop around for cheap wool unless you are very experienced, or are willing to risk spending hours of work on an object that will shrink, fade, or run. A well-made sweater, knitted with good will and good wool, is beyond price; why try to save a dollar on the material? </p><p> Consult the nice expert in the wool shop, and if she doesn't suggest taking an extra skein as insurance against running short, take one anyway. Find out the time limit on returns and exchanges, and mark this on your sales slip. And keep the sales slip with the wool, OK? The saleslady will then love you. Even if you never get around to returning the extra skein, think what a disaster it would be to run short, and to fail to match the dye lot. Anyway, extra skeins are always useful for socks, caps, mittens, color patterns, or stripes. </p><p> If you prefer to economize and love to knit, make your sweaters with very fine wool and many stitches. A thin sweater weighs much less than a great heavy one, and, broadly speaking, wool sells by weight. Fine knitting gives you many more hours of your favorite hobby before you have to sally forth and make another capital investment. </p><p> Discrepancies will occur between dye lots; even with white, even with black. Never start a project without sufficient wool to finish it. </p><p> But on a rainy winter's night who can resist three or four skeins of wool, pleading to be made into a sweater? "I'll go to the wool shop first thing, and match the wool." Oh dear. Famous last words. </p><p> Well, there are several remedies. </p><p> If you can find an almost perfect match, the two shades may be successfully blended by working them in alternate rows for an inch or two. </p><p> Seams will also help to hide the slight color difference of a close match. You may make one or both sleeves of the new color, which will fool the eye. </p><p> If the match is Not Good At All, you can be glad you are making a Zimmermann sweater (I hope you are). Several of these start at the bottom on sleeves and body; the three pieces are united at the underarm, and the shoulders or yoke are worked last. This offers endless opportunities for using up odd wools. Few people embark on a new sweater overnight without material to get them at least to the underarm. So when the wool runs out decide that you had decided on a sweater with a contrasting yoke anyway. Eureka. If you are determined to have a one-color garment, intersperse a few purl rounds where the dye lot change occurs. This is enough to fool most eyes, even if it never fools yours -- you know too much. You can put in a small pretty color pattern at the point of change, which may please you so much that you may decide to continue with different color patterns up to the neck. This is one way of achieving a "famous masterpiece of taste and imagination." Save a few yards of the original color for one of the last patterns, and the whole thing will look as if it had been planned. </p><p> NEEDLES </p><p> Needles are made of so many materials that you can go dizzy taking your pick. Years ago you had your choice of wood, bone, steel, or luxurious tortoiseshell and ivory. The contemporary ones are usually of metal or plastic, and are firm or flexible respectively. </p><p> The U.S., for some reason, employs different size numbers from those in Europe, which are measured in millimeters. A needle gauge is a very useful thing to own, although it and the needles may vary infinitesimally, which sometimes leads to confusion. Occasionally one comes upon a mature needle gauge in which the holes have actually become enlarged through constant use, or by the forcing through of too large needles. </p><p> This all points to the admonition not to take needle sizes too seriously, especially if you tend to knit loosely. </p><p> Tight knitters lead a hard and anxious life. They grab needles and wool so tightly that great strain is put upon their hand muscles, nay, arm, shoulder, and even neck muscles in extreme cases. They must let go of everything from time to time, just to rest, and then resume knitting, with what looks like a careworn expression, although they neither admit, nor, in most cases, believe this. The tight little stitches they make must be forced along their (right) needle, and more tight little stitches force up along their (left) needle, to be squeezed in their turn. The resulting fabric, in knitting worsted, with #8 needles, can have a GAUGE of five stitches to one inch, because of the great tightness. The identical GAUGE may be easily and calmly achieved by a loose knitter on, say, #5 needles. </p><p> If you are a beginning knitter, don't try to knit tightly in order to make your work look neat. </p><p> If you are a habitually tight knitter, try to kick the habit. </p><p> Loose knitting tends to make your stitches look somewhat uneven, but what of it? Are you trying to reproduce a boughten machine-made sweater? Besides, it is surprising what blocking and a few washings will do to uneven knitting. </p><p> I used to think that people in the Olden Days were marvelously even knitters, because all really ancient sweaters are so smooth and regular. Now I realize that they probably knitted just as I do, rather erratically, and that it is Time, the Great Leveller, which has wrought the change -- Time, and many washings. </p><p> Don't fuss too much about one size in needles; it is GAUGE that is important, and...</p></p><h2>Piracy: The Complete History (General Military)</h2><p>When we think of pirates we conjure up images of Blackbeard and Captain Kidd, or even fictional pirates such as Long John Silver, Captain Hook and Captain Jack Sparrow. These historical characters all hailed from one period. Known as "The Golden Age of Piracy", this period only lasted around a quarter of a century - from around 1700 until 1725. However, piracy has been around a lot longer than that. In fact ever since people started venturing onto the sea, others were waiting to waylay them.<br><br>Pirate expert Angus Konstam sails through the brutal history of piracy, from the pirates who plagued the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the Viking raids on northern Europe through the golden age of piracy and on to the era of privateers who flourished during a period of constant warring on the European continent. He then examines the West's initial encounters with Eastern pirates off the Chinese coast whose confederations had sprung up in the 17th century and whose actions were severely hampering the West by the 19th century. Finally Konstam examines the phenomenon of the modern pirate, preying on modern super tankers. The reality of piracy is that it is a vicious, often deadly business. By separating the realities of piracy from the Hollywood-inspired fiction, and by tracing the development of piracy through the centuries, this book gives a realistic vision of what piracy actually involves. <br><br>The book includes approximately 100 color and black &amp; white images, eight maps, a glossary of sea terms, notes on sources and a bibliography.<br><br>Contents <br>Chapter 1: Piracy in the Ancient World; Chapter 2: Medieval Pirates; Chapter 3: The Sea Dogs of the Renaissance; Chapter 4: Mediterranean Corsairs; Chapter 5: The Buccaneers of the Caribbean; Chapter 6: The Golden Age of Piracy; Chapter 7: The Pirate Round; Chapter 8: The Last of the Pirates; Chapter 9 The Chinese Pirates; Chapter 10: Modern Pirates; Chapter 11: Pirates in Fiction; Conclusion</p><p>Angus Konstam is a prolific author, with over 50 historical titles in print. Over 30 of these have been for Osprey. His piratical titles include <i>The History of Pirates</i> (Lyons Press, New York, 1999), <i>Pirates! and Pirates</i>, 1680-1730 (both Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2000) and <i>The Pirate Ship</i> (Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2003). Other publications include <i>History of Shipwrecks, A Historical Atlas of Exploration</i>, and <i>The Spanish Galleon</i>. He studied history and archaeology at the Scottish Universities of Aberdeen and St. Andrews, and is also a former naval officer, an underwater archaeologist and a museum curator. He has advised the archaeologists who excavated Blackbeard's <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i>, and has made several TV appearances as a piratical "talking head" for the History Channel. His latest work is <i>Blackbeard: America's Most Notorious Pirate</i> (Wiley, New York, 2006), which is publishing in early June. The author lives in Edinburgh, UK.<i>Piracy </i>is "well-crafted, carefully-indexed, and smartly produced. <i>Piracy's</i> 320 pages includes maps, reproductions of engravings, and 16 color pages of period illustrations and modern photographs. As with many books on the subject, vivid characters often drive the story... The author clarifies his terms and identifies his sources and occasionally traces how original data were 'improved' over time... In sum, <i>Piracy: The Complete History</i> is a confident introduction to a vast subject from an expert author." -Joseph Gibbs, <i>Naval History, Magazine of the US Naval Institute </i>(February 2009)<br><br>"Without question, the strength of this book is its examination of a striking amount of global pirate history. Konstam begins in the ancient world, covers many chronological eras and geographical zones, including medieval pirates, the Renaissance sea dogs, the Mediterranean corsairs, the 'golden age' and it's decline, pirates in the Indian Ocean, Chinese pirates, modern piracy and fictional pirates... It features color plates and black and white illustrations... For those looking to study world pirates over the <i>longue duree, </i>this book is a worthwhile purchase." -Cherly Fury, <i>The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord</i> (March 2009)<br><br>"Who doesn''t like hearing about pirates? And if my current retirement plan doesn't work out... maybe I could be a pirate ...? Kidding aside, recent events bring piracy to the forefront and it is a fascinating subject. If you want to read an in-depth history that provides the complex history -- you must read <b><i>Piracy: the Complete History</i> b</b>y Angus Konstam. This book is very detailed and contains [much] surprising information..." -Nancy Mehegan, <i>www.vaboomer.com</i> (May 2009)<br><br>Konstam "offers a thorough suvery of piracy from ancient to modern times. His survey offeres more of a military approach than the usual light history, probing strategy, separating fact from fiction, and tracing piracy's development through the centuries. Especially reconmmended for nautical and military history libraries, the depth of coverage and research exceeds most competing books popularizing the history of piracy." -<i>The Bookwatch</i> (December 2008)<br><br>"Angus Konstam is the pirate expert.

Originally written in German in 1941, and subsequently translated into English in 1956, Waldemar Seunig&#39;s &#34;Horsemanship&#34; has become one of the most highly regarded works to be published on the training of the horse its rider. The book explores all aspects of horsemanship beginning with a study of the horse itself and a comprehensive evaluation of the physical and psychological requirements of a good rider. Following a section on the development of the rider&#39;s seat and the use of aids, the author provides a complete course of instruction for the young horse and rider in Part Two, which includes groundwork, backing the horse for the first time, development of the gaits, work in a curb bit, training open country, jumping and a discussion on how defects of conformation, disposition and character affect the training process. Part Three covers advanced work including schooled collection, manege work, piaffe, passage and, finally, the &#34;figures about the ground&#34;.</p><p>Waldemar Sennig was a highly intelligent and educated horseman, a Royal Master of the Horse and a pupil and instructor of both The Spanish Riding School and the Cadre Noir.

Before they can mend their differences, both girls have to learn what it means to be a friend.</p><p>Oscar-winning actor and producer Marlee Matlin makes her writing debut about a topic she knows very well--the difficulties of growing up deaf. Nine-year-old Megan is thrilled when Cindy moves in down the street, even though the two couldn't be more different. Megan is boisterous; Cindy is shy. Megan loves everything with a passion, especially the color purple; Cindy shrinks from attention. Megan is deaf; Cindy can hear. Together, they forge an unlikely friendship that is tested when the two decide to attend summer camp together. There is another deaf child in their bunk, and suddenly Megan seems to forget the promise she made to Cindy to be "BFF," Best Friends Forever. Cindy struggles with this rejection, even as it forces her to step out from behind Megan's shadow and learn to speak up for herself. Once they are home again, the two reconcile when a hair-pulling argument dissolves into laughter. <p> The preeminent author of fiction about children with disabilities has always been the beloved Jean Little (<i>Little by Little</i>, <i>Mine for Keeps</i>, etc.). Having said that, Matlin is no Little, but her writing style is competent and clearly describes the realities of Megan's world. And even though Matlin's gently told story doesn't rise much above the "message" of Megan's disability, it's still a message that youngsters need to hear.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p> <p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!"</p> <p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne's Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry. Among those who work with her, she is known as one of the finest character and action writers in the business. Her work is currently featured in <i>American West, Saturday Evening Post, </i>and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine, as well as other national publications. </p> <p>Bodie's interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That's one you ought to do.

Politics, marriage, sexuality, religious freedom--with an ever-growing list of contentious issues, believers find it harder than ever to hold on to their convictions while treating their friends, neighbors, coworkers, and even family members who disagree with respect and compassion. This isn't just a problem that affects individual Christians; if left unaddressed, the growing gap between the faithful and society's tolerance for public faith will have lasting consequences for the church in America.<br><br>Now the bestselling authors of <i>unChristian</i> turn their data-driven insights toward the thorny question of how Christians talk with people they know and love about the most toxic issues of our day.

Albert Einstein <p>Born on May 15, 1949 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Hans Decoz has been a student of numerology since 1969, when he discovered an old and rather worn out book on the ancient spiritual science in a secondhand book shop in Amsterdam. For many years, he experimented with the tools of numerology, reading and studying everything he could find on the subject. Hans traveled throughout Europe and Asia in search of more understanding and knowledge of the different forms and techniques used in numerology. </p><p>He used it to better understand his friends or acquaintances, for example, or to interpret various events on the universal as well as the personal plane. Only after he had overcome his intense skepticism was he able to see the practice as yet another example of the ultimate unity, integrity, and wholeness of the universe. </p><p>In 1982, Hans began practicing numerology professionally in Houston, Texas. By then, he had a deep understanding-- both of the science, as well as what it suggested about life itself. Soon he had a burgeoning practice, rich with the many strata of Houston's population -- from the hardworking housewife and laborer to the wealthiest of Houston's business elite. </p><p>Ever since he was a child, Hans demonstrated advanced abilities in mathematics and art. He loved to figure out complex mathematical problems and, once completed, put aside such work for hours at his easel where he produced drawings and paintings. These abilities eventually led to fascination with computers, for which he also had a special talent. Now he wanted to combine these native abilities with his understanding of numerology. He also wanted to make that understanding more widely available. In 1985, inspiration struck and Hans developed the renowned computer software program known as the DecozChart. </p><p>That program proved to be revolutionary. It was the first (and to this day it is the only) numerology chart-maker program capable of producing a complete numerology chart that included fifty years of forecasting cycles. The chart itself -- a beautifully designed layout -- was placed on a single page, visually capturing the many cycles and changes each person goes through in any 50-year period. </p><p>Following the chart-maker software program, Hans started working on a computer program that would produce a complete numerology report for individuals. After two years of writing, Hans called on his friend Tom Monte to help edit the data base of text files; together they devoted four years to the creation of a numerology program that provided people with complete personality profiles and future forecasts. Until then, no one had created a program capable of calculating a person's complete numerology chart, and then producing a unique report that described the meaning of each of the person's most important numbers. It is true that some small, rudimentary programs existed, but this was the first program that could produce an in-depth, personal reading that consisted of 25 pages or more. As everyone knows who has received their own personal reading, those numerology reports are written with incredible insight, compassion, and understanding of life. Hans Decoz currently resides in Galveston, Texas. He lectures and offers courses and personal consultations. Hans is currently working on his second book. His first book: Numerology; Key To Your Inner Self with Tom Monte, was published in 1994 by Avery Publishing Group, NY. The book has since been translated in several languages, including Russian, German, Turkish, and Dutch. </p><p>Tom Monte Tom Monte is a professional writer, having written more than 15 books, including the best-sellers Recalled by Life and Living Well Naturally, both with Dr. Anthony Sattilaro.

His stories, as empathetic as they are unforgiving, are like no others in our nation's literature. Published with a moving introduction by the novelist Richard Russo, this collection will stand as its author's final masterpiece.<br></p><p>Although nobody would describe the unflinching stories of Richard Yates as beach reading, a sunny day and a soothing breeze may provide the best possible antidote to the author's trademark gloom. But even if you open the book in the dead of winter, don't expect to put it down, for Yates will draw you in despite yourself. Like the English novelist Anita Brookner--or, more to the point, like his protï¿½gï¿½ Raymond Carver--he is attracted to small lives. And like a diviner, he seeks out and locates precisely those moments when this smallness is sensed by his characters.<p> The protagonist of "The Canal," for example, spent most of World War II behind a desk, serving on the European front only during the final months of the conflict. At a postwar cocktail party, however, Miller and his wife encounter a former military officer, and the two begin to exchange stories. It turns out that the officer was decorated for valor in the very same battle that occasioned a major dressing-down for Miller. "I'll put it this way," he was told by his exasperated superior. "You give me more goddamn trouble than all the rest of the men in this squad put together. You're more goddamn trouble than you're worth. You got an answer for that?" Obviously he didn't--and still doesn't.</p><p> In an introduction to the 27 stories collected here, Richard Russo celebrates Yates's influence as a teacher at the Iowa Writer's Workshop. Any reader of Raymond Carver, to take just one conspicuous example, will recognize the atmosphere of lonely despair, coupled with small ambitions, that he absorbed from his mentor. It's a fascinating study in literary ancestry, and offers yet another reason to pick up this essential and long-overdue volume. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Richard Yates was the author of the novels <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, <i>A Special Providence</i>, <i>Disturbing the Peace</i>, <i>The Easter Parade</i>, <i>A Good School</i>, <i>Young Hearts Crying</i>, and <i>Cold Spring Harbor</i>.

He has slightly raised the sandbank behind them for shelter from the August wind, which blows over the receding line of waves and out to sea under high wisps of haze. They have removed their shoes and socks and are gently wiggling their toes as they sit, enjoying the cool damp of the deeper sand&#x2014;an activity that struck me, at the age of six, as uncharacteristically frivolous for this couple always dressed in gray, dark blue or black. Even on the beach and despite the heat, my grandfather keeps his black fedora on his nearly bald head; he is wearing his spotless white shirt and, as always, a black bow tie, a large one, larger than bow ties normally are, with two ends dangling over his chest, making it look from a distance as though his neck were adorned with the silhouette of a black angel spreading its wings. My mother made his peculiar bow ties according to his instructions, and in all his long life I never saw him without one of those black ties with tails like a dress coat; he must have owned dozens. There&#x2019;s one here somewhere among my books, a relic of a far, forgotten age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After half an hour, he made up his mind to take off his jacket. Then he removed his gold cufflinks and put them in his left pocket. Next, he went so far as to roll up his shirtsleeves, or rather, he ï¿½carefully folded them over, twice, to a point just under his elbow, each fold exactly the width of the starched cuff, and now he sits with his neatly folded jacket draped over his arm, its silk lining gleaming in the afternoon light, as if he is posing for an Impressionist portrait. His gaze seems to wander over the distant crowd, losing its way among the shrieking, splashing children, the shouting, laughing day-ï¿½trippers chasing after each other as if they were children again. What he sees is something like a James Ensor painting set in motion, although he despises the work of that Ostend blasphemer with the English name. Ensor is a &#x201c;dauber,&#x201d; and along with &#x201c;tosspot&#x201d; and &#x201c;riff-ï¿½raff,&#x201d; &#x201c;dauber&#x201d; is the worst accusation he can make. They&#x2019;re all daubers, today&#x2019;s painters; they&#x2019;ve completely lost touch with the classical tradition, the subtle, noble craft of the old masters. They muddle along with no respect for the laws of anatomy, don&#x2019;t even know how to glaze, never mix their own paint, use turpentine like water, and are ignorant of the secrets of grinding your own pigments, of fine linseed oil and the blowing of ï¿½siccatives&#x2014; no wonder there are no more great painters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The wind is growing colder now. He retrieves his cufflinks from his pocket, rolls down his sleeves, neatly fastens his cuffs, puts on his jacket, and tenderly drapes his wife&#x2019;s black lace mantilla over her shoulders and over the lustrous knot in her dark gray hair. Come, Gabrielle, he says, and they stand, pick up their shoes, and with some effort begin the ascent to the promenade, he with the legs of his trousers rolled up six inches or so, she with her long black socks stuffed into her shoes. Under their dark forms, I see their four white calves swinging, slow and measured, over the sand. They make their way to the bluestone steps that lead to the promenade, where they will sit down on the nearest bench, brush and pat off the sand until their feet are thoroughly clean, pull their black socks over their alabaster feet, and tie their shoes with what they call drawstrings instead of laces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for me, after the collapse of the warren of tunnels that I dug for my large stone marbles&#x2014;my treasured &#x201c;taws&#x201d;&#x2014;I run shivering to my mother. The tide is rising again, she says, rubbing the warmth back into me as the first puffy clouds form over the dunes behind us. The wind sweeps over the dune tops, as if to muss their grassy hair, and those large, sand-ï¿½colored creatures brace themselves for the night ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My grandfather, his gleaming cane of varnished elm wood already in his hand, is waiting restlessly for us to reach the promenade. Then he takes the lead; he is not a tall man&#x2014;five foot six, I often hear him say&#x2014;but wherever he goes, people make way. With his head erect, his black boots polished to perfection, a sharp crease in his trousers, arm in arm with his unspeaking wife and his cane in the other hand, he strides out ahead of us with slight impatience, glancing back now and then and calling out that we&#x2019;ll miss our train if we don&#x2019;t pick up the pace. He walks like a retired soldier, which is to say not pounding his heels oafishly into the ground, but always landing on the ball of the foot, as a soldier should, the habit of more than half a century. Then he somehow slips out of view in my memory, and overcome by the sudden radiant clarity of this scene from all those years ago, I&#x2019;m so tired I could fall asleep on the spot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without any transition, the next image I have of him is that of a man silently weeping. He is seated at the small table where he painted and wrote, in his gray smock, his black hat on his head. The yellow light of morning shines through the small, vine-ï¿½framed window; in his hands I see one of the many reproductions he tore out of art books and used to practice copying (pinning the reproduction to a board that he attached to his palette with two wooden pegs). He holds the picture in his hands; I cannot see what it is, but I see that tears are running down his cheeks and he is silently mouthing words. I climbed the three stairs to my grandfather&#x2019;s room to tell him about the rat skeleton I&#x2019;d found; now I quickly, quietly back away, my steps muffled by the carpet on the stairs, and close his door behind me. But later, while he&#x2019;s downstairs having coffee, I slip back up to the room and find the picture on his table. It is a painting of a nude woman with her back to the viewer, a slender woman with dark hair, lying on some kind of sofa or bed in front of a red curtain. Her serene, dreamy expression is visible in a mirror held up for her by a cherub with a blue ribbon over his shoulder; her bare, slender back and round buttocks are prominent. My eyes drift to her frail shoulders, the delicate hair curling around her neck, and then back to her derriere, which is thrust almost obscenely toward the viewer. Shocked, I put down the reproduction, I go downstairs, there is my grandfather in the kitchen, beside my mother, singing a French tune he remembers from the war.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My childhood years were overrun with his tales of the First World War, always the war and nothing but the war, vague heroics in muddy fields under a rain of bombs, the rat-ï¿½a-ï¿½tat of gunfire, phantoms screaming in the dark, orders roared in French&#x2014;all conjured up from his rocking chair with great feeling for spectacle&#x2014;and always barbed wire, shrapnel whizzing past our ears, submachine guns rattling, flares tracing high arcs across the dark heavens, mortars and howitzers firing, billions of blistering bombs in ten thousand thundering trenches, while the tea-ï¿½sipping aunties nodded beatifically and about the only thing that stuck with me was that my grandfather must have been a hero in days as distant as the Middle Ages I&#x2019;d heard about in school. To me, he was still a hero; he gave me fencing lessons, sharpened my pocketknife, taught me how to draw clouds by rubbing an eraser over shapes sketched with a piece of charred wood from the fireplace, and how to render the myriad leaves of a tree without drawing each one separately&#x2014;the true secret of art, as he called it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stories were meant to be forgotten, since after all, they always came back again, even the strangest stories of art and artists. I knew that old Beethoven had worked on his ninth symphony like a man possessed because he was deaf, but one day a disturbing detail was added: he didn&#x2019;t even go to the trouble of visiting the toilet while he was working, instead he did &#x201c;his business&#x201d; by the piano. Consequently&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;&#x201c;the man who wrote that lovely song about all men becoming brothers did his composing next to a heap of dung.&#x201d; I imagined the great composer, deaf as a post, seated in a Viennese interior with the capitals of the columns painted gold, wearing his luxuriant wig, gaiters, and galoshes, next to a towering pyramid of excrement, and whenever the miraculous adagio from the Pastoral Symphony drifted through the house on one of those long dreary Sunday afternoons, while my parents and grandparents nodded off on the brown floral sofa by the radio, I would picture a mountain of crap next to a glossy lacquered spinet as a cuckoo from the Wienerwald warbled along with the woodwinds and violins and my grandfather kept his eyes tightly closed. He was a firm believer in romantic genius; his reverence for it ran so deep that he could not face the mundane world of his home and family at such exalted moments. Not until many years later did it dawn on me that he himself had spent about a year and a half next to a real dung heap in the miserable trenches, where as soon as you put your head above the parapet in search of a better place to do your business, you were punished with a bullet through the brain. Thus the things he wished to forget kept coming back, in shards of stories or absurd details, and whether hell or heaven was the subject, shards and details like these were the puzzle pieces I had to fit together before I could begin to understand what had gone on inside him all his life: the battle between the transcendent, which he yearned for, and the memory of death and destruction, which held him in its clutches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At home, my grandfather invariably wore a smock&#x2014;always the same short white or light gray garment, the length of an old-ï¿½fashioned dressing gown&#x2014;over his white shirt and bow tie. No matter how my mother and her mother washed and boiled those old cotton smocks, which he wore with a certain flair, they remained mottled with stains: scattered swipes of oil paint in all the colors of the rainbow, criss-ï¿½crossing fingerprints, a composition of careless, intriguing smears, the raffish graffiti left there after the real work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That real work, which he had carried out uninterrupted since his early retirement as a disabled veteran at the age of forty-ï¿½five, was painting for pleasure. The small room where he stood in front of the small window day in and day out smelled of linseed oil, turpentine, linen, oil paint. Yes, even the odor of the large erasers, cut down to size with a knife, could be detected in the irreproducible mixture that gave the room its ambience, the glamour of the endless hours he passed in silence, zealously yet fruitlessly emulating the great masters. He was a superb copyist and knew all the secrets of the old materials and recipes that painters had used and passed down since the Renaissance. After the war he had taken evening classes in drawing and painting in his home city of Ghent, despite all the times his late father, a painter of frescoes in churches and chapels, had warned him against it. Although he was still doing heavy manual labor at the time, he pressed on, and just after reaching the usual marrying age, he earned a &#x201c;certificate of competence in fine-ï¿½art painting and anatomical drawing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From his window he could see a bend in the Scheldt River, the slow cows in their pastures, the heavily laden barges chugging past low in the water in the morning, the faster-ï¿½moving empty riverboats leaving the city with a shallow draft at day&#x2019;s end. Countless times he painted that view, each time in a different light with a new set of hues; another time of day, another season, another mood. He painted each leaf of the red creeper from nature&#x2014;apparently, art sometimes demanded exceptions to its great law of illusion&#x2014;and when he copied a detail of a Titian or Rubens, he knew himself to be practiced in patience, in sketching accurately with charcoal or graphite, in the secrets of mixing colors and thinning pigments, and in waiting just long enough for the first layer to dry before adding a second, which gave the impression of depth and transparency&#x2014;another of the many great secrets of art.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His grand passions were treetops, clouds, and folds in fabric. In these formless forms he could let go, lose himself in a dream world of light and dark, in clouds congealed in oil paint, chiaroscuro, a world where nobody else could intrude, because something&#x2014;it was hard to say what&#x2014;had broken inside him. His warmth and generosity were always tinged with shyness, as if he were afraid that people would come too close because he had been too friendly. At the same time, he exuded a higher, nobler strain of friendly guilelessness, and that naï¿½vetï¿½ was at the core of his good humor. His marriage to Gabrielle seemed idyllic, if you didn&#x2019;t know better. Intertwined like two old trees forced to extend their branches through each other&#x2019;s crowns for decades in their struggle for scarce sunlight, they passed their simple days, which were punctuated solely by the frivolous-ï¿½seeming gaiety of their daughter, their only child. Days vanished into the folds of distracted time. He painted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The room that served as his studio, three steps up from the small landing, was also their bedroom; it is hard to believe how unremarkable it once was to live in cramped quarters. The bed was by the wall behind his small, makeshift desk, so that his wife would have something to lean against in her sleep&#x2014;she slept far away from him despite their narrow bed. Clouds and folds in fabric; treetops and water. The finest paintings in his staunchly traditional body of work each contain a few shapeless smudges, strange abstract masses that he regarded as tokens of fidelity to nature, as if he were painting from the model that God laid out before his eyes and bade him unfurl in the meticuï¿½lous patience of his daily work as a lowly copyist. But it was also a tribute he dutifully paid, his way of mourning the untimely death of his father, the lowly church painter Franciscus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>War and Turpentine </b>by Stefan Hertmans.

Someone who helps us make sense of the challenges we face. Who guides us as we navigate times of change. Who counsels us as we move along life&#x2019;s path. <br>Who among us wouldn&#x2019;t want to call on a person with wisdom and experience when we have to make important decisions about our careers and our personal lives? Especially when those decisions are fraught with risk and uncertainty, and complicated by fundamental changes in the world around us. <br>And let&#x2019;s face it, wisdom is at a premium, as we&#x2019;ve experienced an unbelievable amount of change over the last few years. <br>When I first had the idea of writing this book, the stock market was at an all-time high, prosperity was increasing all over the world, and megamillionaires were being created every other day. It looked like the economic good times would never end. Quite frankly, it was an environment in which many people who weren&#x2019;t getting rich&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s most of us&#x2014;were wondering why not, and whether we should be approaching our lives and careers in a very different way. <br>The assumption, of course, was that wealth equaled success and success equaled happiness. The initial concept for this book was to help people think through how to achieve happiness and meaning in their lives within that environment. <br>And then things changed, seemingly overnight. <br>In a breathtakingly short period of time, the economic world as we knew it imploded. A company that was once synonymous with American economic success, General Motors, went bankrupt. The disintegration of a single Wall Street icon, Lehman Brothers, threatened the entire global finance system. Average people&#x2014;like you and me and the folks across the street&#x2014;unwittingly helped overzealous lenders drive the nation&#x2019;s mortgage industry and housing market over a cliff. <br>As a society, we ran headfirst into an inflection point. <br>What is an inflection point? It is what Andy Grove, the founder and former CEO of Intel, defined as an event that fundamentally changes the way we think and act. Usually, an inflection point isn&#x2019;t a little change. It is a moment when&#x2014;by choice or not&#x2014;we pivot from the path down which we are traveling and head in an entirely different direction. <br>During the past dozen years, we&#x2019;ve gone through several extraordinary inflection points. We have experienced a series of economic and political events that caused the future to look very different from what we&#x2019;d expected it would. <br>Until not too long ago, a whole generation of college graduates believed they were destined to follow the path of the founders of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook and become multimillionaires before they were thirty. Investment banking was seen as the guaranteed path to becoming a &#x201c;master of the universe.&#x201d; People were celebrated as heroes for running companies based on business models that, in any other time, would have been considered laughable. Policy makers in Washington, DC, were so confident that the stock market would keep rising&#x2014;seemingly forever&#x2014;that they considered privatizing Social Security, the economic safety net of the American working man and woman. <br>Beginning in 2007 and continuing to this day, we&#x2019;ve been reminded of two rules that we&#x2019;d apparently forgotten: (1) what goes up does eventually come down, and (2) businesses built on a foundation of smoke and mirrors will surely fail. <br>At breakneck speed, discussions about the stock market turned to preserving capital, not growing it. People with jobs were satisfied just to keep them&#x2014;forget about promotions and raises. Homeowners went from visions of windfall profits to hopes of avoiding foreclosure. Folks with newly minted college and graduate degrees suddenly faced a frozen job market. <br>Even those people whose financial lives did not collapse had a tremendous scare. And we&#x2019;re all trying to guess if there&#x2019;s a new problem just over the horizon. <br>In times of extraordinary challenges and dizzying change&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s happening around us or to us&#x2014;we can all use a wise guide. A person who helps us think through our basic assumptions about what we want and need in our lives, about what &#x201c;success&#x201d; means to us and how best to navigate our lives during unsettling times. <br>Wise men and women come in plenty of flavors and sizes, and with varying degrees of insight. Like beauty, wisdom is often in the eye of the beholder. And the wisdom you find depends a lot on the kind of wisdom you may benefit from at a particular moment. For some, the ideal wise person looks like Abraham Lincoln or Mother Teresa; for others it&#x2019;s Warren Buffett or Oprah Winfrey. <br>The wise man I&#x2019;ve found is a mixture: he has the business acumen of Warren Buffett, and the warmth and spirit of Morrie Schwartz, Mitch Albom&#x2019;s professor in the book <i>Tuesdays with Morrie.</i> He also has a rather humorous resemblance to Yoda, the wise, skilled, and experienced Jedi knight of <i>Star Wars</i> fame. <br>Although my wise man looks a bit like Yoda, in place of a light saber he wields razor-sharp logic and scalpel-like insight. He is a real-life teacher, mentor, and guide through challenging, risky, and downright scary adventures. His name is Howard Stevenson. <br>Howard is an entrepreneur, an author, and a philanthropist. And for forty years, he has been one of the most important and respected professors at Harvard Business School. He possesses an amazing combination of business brilliance, keen psychological perception, energetic spirit, and long-term vision. He has an endearing perspective on life, something I didn&#x2019;t fully appreciate until it was almost gone. <br>Howard is exactly the kind of person that so many of us would like to be able to turn to when important decisions are to be made or challenges met. One whose wisdom and experience have guided thousands of men and women through the inflection points in their lives. <br>Over the course of four decades, Howard has taught, mentored, and counseled thousands of Harvard MBAs, graduate students, and global business leaders. His students have included world leaders, CEOs of major corporations, and entrepreneurs whose visions have changed our world. <br>Numbered among Howard&#x2019;s many students, friends, and confidants are some of the most successful businesspeople and philanthropists in the world. They have included people like Jorge Paolo Lemann, the Brazilian billionaire co-owner of the international beverage conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev, William Bowes, one of the creators of the U.S. bio tech industry; Hansjï¿½rg Wyss, the Swiss medical appliance industry pioneer and mega philanthropist; the late Frank Batten, who created the Weather Channel; and Arthur Rock, the legendary investor who helped launch Intel and Apple. <br>Why have business icons like Lemann, Bowes, Wyss, Batten, and Rock&#x2014;people who have reached the pinnacle of professional success&#x2014;continued to look to this remarkable man? For the same reason that I do: to benefit from the insight, wisdom, warmth, and pragmatic perspective that this rumpled Harvard Business School professor shares with everyone whose life he has touched. <br>This book is my way of introducing you to my friend and mentor Howard Stevenson. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Every book has a catalyst, something that makes an author believe, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s essential that I tell people about this.&#x201d; For some authors that moment feels like an earthquake or a thunderclap; for others, it&#x2019;s a slowly dawning realization or a voice whispering in the mind&#x2019;s ear. <br>To me, that moment felt like a punch to the gut and the urge to vomit. <br>I was standing in the parking lot of Harvard Business School one mild winter day in Cambridge, Massachusetts, staring dumbly at a colleague who was telling me something I didn&#x2019;t want to believe. I heard his words, but I couldn&#x2019;t absorb their meaning. &#x201c;Howard had a heart attack two hours ago. It&#x2019;s bad.&#x201d; <br>At age sixty-six, Howard Stevenson was a legend at Harvard Business School. An iconic teacher, he was an innovator who defined the academic field of entrepreneurial business. He was a successful businessman who&#x2019;d made a fortune several times over, and a philanthropist and philanthropic adviser of the first rank. A towering figure among corporate leaders, he was a warm friend and a generous mentor. <br>Howard was considered the father of entrepreneurship at HBS, and he was like a second father to me. <br>We had first met when I was a thirty-something &#x201c;mid-career&#x201d; graduate student at Harvard&#x2019;s Kennedy School and he agreed to advise me on an independent study project. From our initial conversation, I found myself oddly connected to this Ivy League scholar with a quirky smile. His ruffled hair, piercing gaze, and slightly hunched posture were an amusing contrast to the interior man: brilliant, witty, playful, and endlessly curious. I came to adore his unique spirit. <br>And now&nbsp;&#x2026; &#x201c;They had to give him CPR. He might not make it.&#x201d; <br>Despite getting a clean bill of health from his doctor only weeks earlier, Howard had collapsed in cardiac arrest as he walked across campus after lunch. It had been an otherwise typical day until his ticker simply stopped ticking. <br>I was frantic at the news and spent the next several hours calling colleagues and rushing from one office to the next, vainly trying to get some update on Howard&#x2019;s condition. It was only days later that his assistant, Bobbie, could give me good news. Howard would be all right&#x2014;but only because of amazing good luck: he had collapsed next to a building that had a portable defibrillator, and someone immediately brought the device to his side; plus the HBS campus is just two miles from a good hospital. (That evening, when I saw my friend Josh Silverman&#x2014;a brilliant surgeon and scientist&#x2014;I lear...</p><h2>The Killings at Badger&#39;s Drift</h2><p>Although the coroner finds nothing suspicious about elderly Emily Simpson&#39;s death, many suspect murder and the investigation preceeds with Sergeant Troy stumbling blindly over clues and Chief Inspector Barnaby picking up the pieces</p><p>Graham won the Macavity Award, for Best First Mystery of 1988, for <i>The Killings at Badger's Drift</i>.

Author of such landmarks of modern American fiction as Reflections in a Golden Eye and The Ballad of the Sad Cafï¿½, Carson McCullers was the enfant terrible of the literary world of the 1940s and 1950s. Gifted but tormented, vulnerable but exploitative, McCullers led a life that had all the elements--and more--of a tragic novel.From McCullers&#39;s birth in Columbus, Georgia, in 1917 to her death in upstate New York in 1967, The Lonely Hunter thoroughly covers every significant event in, and aspect of, the writer&#39;s life: her rise as a young literary sensation; her emotional, artistic, and sexual eccentricities and entanglements; her debilitating illnesses; her travels in America and Europe; and the provenance of her works from their earliest drafts through their book, stage, and film versions.To research her subject, Virginia Spencer Carr visited all of the important p</p><p>Virginia Spencer Carr holds the John B. and Elena Diaz-Verson Amos Distinguished Chair in English at Georgia State University.

Watching the guest of honor make the obligatory final curtain call evoked a predictable yet uncomfortable melancholy, but worse yet was the sense of the other guests' eyes upon her. She imagined their whispers: Isn't it about time we threw one of these parties for <i>her,</i> the dowager queen of the television drama? Doesn't she realize her time has passed?<br><br>As she raised her champagne flute to join the others in a toast to Maury, the man who had been her agent throughout her career, Julia forced herself to smile. Despite the critics' lukewarm appreciation of her talent, she knew she was a fine actress. No one would detect her dismay at realizing that she was one of the oldest people present, that she could no longer count on being the most beautiful woman in the room, that maybe it was best that she retire with some dignity instead of lingering on long past her prime.<br><br>No doubt the stars and would-be stars assembled there expected her own announcement soon, especially since <i>Family Tree</i> had just ended its lengthy run. She had hoped for at least another two years, but as the three endearing cherubs who played her grandchildren grew into sulky adolescents with various addictions and attitude problems, the program's once-spectacular ratings had begun a gradual but unmistakably downward slide. The final blow had come the previous winter, when the actor who played her son-in-law developed a particularly nasty infection in one of his pectoral implants. When his hospitalization forced them to shut down production for a month and show reruns during sweeps week, the studio heads decided not to renew any of their contracts. Most of the cast moved on to other projects, but for the first time in over two decades, Julia found herself facing a summer hiatus that threatened to extend indefinitely.<br><br>If she were planning to leave the business, this would seem to be the time to do it. Money wouldn't be a problem; she had invested her earnings so wisely that she wouldn't need to earn a paycheck to maintain her lifestyle -- even with the ungodly amount of alimony she had to pay her third husband. But to retire now, before she had starred in a hit movie, something meaningful and important and true -- that would be unbearable.<br><br>A handsome young waiter smiled as he offered her another glass of champagne. Drowning her sorrows didn't seem like such a bad idea, given that her series was over and Maury was abandoning her, so she placed her empty glass on the waiter's tray and took another. As she raised it to her lips, Maury caught her eye and inclined his head in the direction of his study. She took a hasty sip and nodded to indicate she would join him there. If he intended to scold her for drinking too much, she'd scold him right back. What was he thinking, retiring when she needed him so desperately?<br><br>"You look lovely," he greeted her, kissing her on the cheek as she entered the study. He closed the heavy door behind them, shutting out the noise of the party.<br><br>"Thank you, Maury. You look rather lovely yourself."<br><br>He grinned and tugged at the sleeves of his elegant tuxedo. "Evelyn insisted," he said. "I didn't want such an ostentatious send-off. I would have preferred eighteen holes and a quiet lunch at the club with a few friends."<br><br>"And disappoint everyone who wanted to bid you a proper good-bye?" Julia tried keep her voice light, but she couldn't prevent some bitterness from slipping in. "It's not like you to put your golf game ahead of your friends."<br><br>"Now, Julia, don't be like that." He placed a hand at the small of her back and guided her to a soft tapestry-covered sofa in front of the fireplace. "You're going to be well looked after. Your new agent will be able to do more for you than I have these past few years."<br><br>The apology in his voice touched her. "I've had no complaints," Julia said, resting her hand on his arm. "There's no one in this world I trust more than you."<br><br>"Thank you, Julia." Maury cleared his throat and drew out his handkerchief. "That means a lot to me." Abruptly he strode over to his desk, and when his back was turned, Julia watched him fondly as he composed himself. Maury was a good man, one of Hollywood's last true gentlemen. He had been her first husband's oldest and dearest friend. He and his wife, Evelyn, had seen her through Charles's death, and the two foolish marriages and bitter divorces that followed. He had insisted that the producers of <i>Family Tree</i> audition her for the role of Grandma Wilson despite their complaints that she wasn't the right type. He had unraveled hundreds of management snarls and eased countless disappointments throughout the years. Maury was a true friend in a city that knew little of friendship and everything about opportunism and greed.<br><br>He tucked his handkerchief away and picked up a thin stack of papers bound by three gold brads. "What's this?" she asked as he placed the papers in her hands.<br><br>"A little farewell present. You didn't think I'd leave you without one last great project, did you?"<br><br>That was precisely what she had thought, but she wouldn't tell him that. She glanced at the top sheet of the script for the writer's name. "Who's Ellen Henderson? What else has she done?"<br><br>"You won't have heard of her. This is her first major motion picture."<br><br>"Oh, Maury." Julia frowned and tossed the script onto the coffee table.<br><br>He took up the papers and sat down beside her. "Don't 'Oh, Maury' me before you read it. This is the project we've been searching for. It has heart, it has warmth, and it has a fantastic part for you." He placed the script in her lap and closed her hands around it. "Trust me."<br><br>"Who's directing?"<br><br>"Ellen is."<br><br>The alcohol helped flame her temper. "This is your big plan for getting me my breakthrough role? I've won four Emmys and a Golden Globe, and you give me a script written by a nobody. How dare you, after all I've sacrificed?" The last words came out almost as a sob, which she tried to disguise with another sip of champagne.<br><br>Gently Maury took the glass. "Don't hold her inexperience against her. Two years ago her student film won an honorable mention at Sundance. Plus, William Bernier is producing."<br><br>Julia raised her eyebrows at him, her anger forgotten. "I thought he had a three-picture deal with -- "<br><br>"He does. This will be one of those projects. We'll have all the perks and publicity a major studio can provide."<br><br>"That's not bad," Julia admitted, picking up the script. Even if the production fell through, Bernier would remember that she had been willing to take a chance on a neophyte director for his sake. Not every actress of her caliber would take such a risk, and it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a man like Bernier in her debt.<br><br>"I'll leave you alone to read it." Maury patted her knee and rose. "If you don't love it, I promise I'll go out there in front of all those people and tell them I'm canceling my retirement until I can find you the project of your dreams."<br><br>"Don't tempt me," Julia teased as he left the room, though she knew such an announcement would embarrass her more than it would him.<br><br>Alone in the restful silence of the study, she settled back on the sofa and decided to skim through the first few scenes. If nothing else, Maury's script would provide an escape from an evening of phony smiles and niceties and too much rich food. She read the cover page aloud to test the sound of the title. <i>"A Patchwork Life,"</i> she said, and winced. She wanted <i>Masterpiece Theatre,</i> and Maury had given her something so hokey it could have been plucked minutes before from a Midwestern cornfield. If Bernier was half the savvy producer his reputation claimed, he would change that title before releasing a single dollar. Shaking her head and expecting the worst, she turned to the first page and began to read.<br><br>Within a few minutes she forgot the party, the humiliating dearth of offers, the patronizing responses of the few movie producers who owed Maury too much to avoid returning his phone calls. A woman named Sadie Henderson and her life in pioneer-era Kansas drew her in until they became more real than the tapestry sofa beneath her, more vivid than the music of the orchestra and the celebration just beyond the study door. She could almost taste the dust in her mouth as the script transported her to the small prairie homestead Sadie struggled to build with her husband, Augustus. Her heart broke when Augustus died, leaving Sadie with two young sons. Alone, Sadie persisted despite grasshopper plagues and drought when other neighbors gave up and returned to homes back east. She shared Sadie's grief when she sold off cherished family quilts to raise money to improve the farm. Sadie then took in sewing from her more successful neighbors, running the farm by day and stitching her neighbors' quilts late into the night. Her quilting kept the family alive until at last, years later, the farm flourished.<br><br>Long after she finished the last page, Julia held the script to her chest, lost in the details of Sadie's hardship and triumph. In Sadie's place, Julia would have crumbled in a week. She longed to meet Sadie, understand the source of her strength, and somehow harness that power for herself.<br><br>The door opened, startling her out of her reverie. "Well?" Maury asked, sitting beside her.<br><br>"It was quite good," she said cautiously, testing him. "But who would pay to see a movie like this, old ladies and nuns? It's a little -- well, I don't know. A little too squeaky-clean." She thumbed through the script, shaking her head. "Maybe you should see if Sally Fields is available."<br><br>"How can you say that?" Maury protested. "You said you wanted something meaningful, something worthy of your talent. This story has all the pathos and character development you wanted -- or at least I thought you wanted."<br><br>"Relax, Maury. I didn't say I wouldn't consider it; I'm just not sure what this will do for me."<br><br>"It'll get you an Oscar nomination, that's what it'll do," he said, but his voice had lost some of its distress.<br><br>"It does have some great monologues," she admitted, but suddenly a horrible thought struck her. "Which part did you have in mind for me?"<br><br>"Sadie Henderson, of course. Not when she's in her twenties, but after that. Bernier will get his best makeup people. I'll insist on it."<br><br>She was too relieved to notice Maury's implicit admission that, without makeup miracles, she was far too old to play anyone younger than a matriarch. For a moment she had feared that Maury intended her to play the cruel elderly neighbor who tried to buy up the Henderson farm.<br><br>"So are you interested or not? Just say the word, and I'll send this along to Anne Bancroft, Judi Dench -- "<br><br>"I'm interested," she interrupted. She refused to entertain even for a moment the thought of Dame Judi collecting a golden statuette for a role Julia had declined.<br><br>"Then I have someone I'd like you to meet." Maury crossed the room, opened the study door, and ushered a young woman inside. She was slender and dressed in what was likely her best suit, but her unfashionable haircut and lack of makeup marked her as a breed apart from all the other young women at the party. "This is Ellen Henderson."<br><br>"Miss Merchaud, it is such an honor to meet you." The young woman approached and shook her hand. "I've admired your work since I was a little girl."<br><br>Julia twisted a wince into a smile. "That long, hmm?" The young woman's grip was strong and confident, and suddenly Julia realized something. "Your name is Henderson. Are you a descendant of Sadie Henderson?"<br><br>"She was my great-grandmother. My script is based on her diaries."<br><br>"I'm so delighted to hear that," Julia exclaimed, forgetting her reserve. She so wanted to believe that Sadie had been a real woman who had lived and breathed and walked the same world she walked.<br><br>"Your writing makes Sadie live again," Maury said.<br><br>Ellen blushed at the compliment. "It's the actor who brings the script to life. Miss Merchaud, there's no one in the world I'd rather have portray my great-grandmother than you."<br><br>Years in the business had taught Julia to suspect flattery. "And why is that?"<br><br>"You have this core of strength, this resilience. I've seen it in every part you've played, ever since Mrs. Dormouse in <i>The Meadows of Middlebury."</i><br><br>"You saw <i>Meadows?"</i> That couldn't be. Mrs. Dormouse was her first major role, but <i>Meadows</i> was a children's film that had quickly slipped into obscurity despite strong critical acclaim. Besides, Ellen hadn't even been born when it came out. For that matter, her parents had probably been too young to see it.<br><br>"My public library ran it during its summer film festival when I was in the fourth grade." Ellen gave her a shy smile. "I loved the book, but when I saw how actors brought all those characters to life, I was transfixed -- and transformed. Especially when I saw how you made Mrs. Dormouse more real than she had been even in my imagination. That was the moment I knew I wanted to make movies when I grew up."<br><br>Ellen's genuine admiration hit home. "I'll take the part," Julia said, without thinking of contracts or box office or who might share top billing.<br><br>Ellen's face lit up. "Oh, Miss Merchaud, thank you." She seized Julia's hand and shook it again. "You won't regret this. I promise."<br><br>Julia laughed and eased her hand free. "I'm sure it will be a delightful experience." She raised her eyebrows at Maury, who recognized his cue.<br><br>"Miss Merchaud and I have some details to discuss," he said, showing Ellen to the door. "Why don't you go on out and enjoy the rest of the party?"<br><br>Ellen looked uncomfortable. "If you don't mind -- if you won't be needing me, I think I'd rather go home. It's getting late."<br><br>As Maury promised her they'd be in touch, Julia wondered how long the awkward little wren had been forced to mingle among that crowd of peacocks as she waited for Julia to read her script.<br><br>When they were alone, Maury said, "You've just won her loyalty for life. Bernier took on the project on the condition that she would obtain a major star for the lead role."<br><br>"Really?" Julia felt a rush of pleasure at being considered a major star by a man like Bernier, but the sensation was quickly followed by anger that she had not taken the compliment in stride. Dame Judi no doubt heard such praise twenty times a day. "I wonder why she didn't mention it."<br><br>"She wanted to be sure you took the part because you truly loved her story, not because you felt sorry for her."<br><br>"If she keeps that up, this town will eat her alive." Still, the young woman's sincerity was oddly refreshing. Julia wished she had not been in such a hurry to dismiss her.<br><br>"She'll learn."<br><br>"The sooner the better, for her sake," Julia said. "So, when do we get started? Will we be shooting on location?"<br><br>"We'll have to for some of the exterior shots," Maury said apologetically.<br><br>"That's fine." Then she added, almost to herself, "Some time away would be good for me."<br><br>"I'm glad you think so, because I was planning to send you on a little trip."<br><br>"A week at Aurora Borealis?" Wouldn't that be just like Maury, to pamper her at her favorite retreat in Ojai.<br><br>"Not exactly. This will be more of a working vacation." He was smiling, but he still looked tentative. "You need to learn some new skills for this part."<br><br>"I already know how to ride a horse."<br><br>"But you don't know how to quilt, unless you've been keeping secrets from me."<br><br>"You know I don't keep secrets from you." Then she paused. "Do I r...</p><h2>Fletch Won</h2><p>Fletch Won As a fledgling reporter, Fletch is doing more flailing than anything else. That and floating around from department to department trying to figure where he fits in. His managing editor&#x2019;s got him pegged for the society pages, but the kind of society Fletch gets involved with is anything but polite. Fletch Won His first big interview, a millionaire lawyer with a crooked streak and an itch to give away some of his ill-gotten gains, ends up dead in the News-Tribune&#x2019;s parking lot before Fletch can ask question number one. So Fletch ends up going after the murderer instead, and ends up learning a thing or two about crime and punishment. Fletch Won At the same time, he&#x2019;s supposed to be covering (or maybe uncovering) a health spa that caters to all its clients needs, and gets hired as a very personal trainer. Never mind that he&#x2019;s supposed to be getting married at the end of the week; Fletch has a few other engagements to take care of first.</p><p>Gregory Mcdonald was born on February 15, 1937, in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University, having been accepted at the age of sixteen, but insists his real education came through the international yacht troubleshooting business he created and ran to support himself at Harvard. Described by critics as the inventor of the sunlight mystery, Mcdonald has published twenty-six books - fifteen of which are mysteries. Mcdonald's first book, Running Scared (1964) was hugely controversial when it first came out, because of its argument for rational suicide and its critique of the Ivy League and its complementary institutions for their role in creating a cold, dehumanized, and self-destructive society. The reaction so shocked Mcdonald that it took him ten years to publish his next book. Seven of those ten years, from 1966 to 1973, were spent working at the Boston Globe as a columnist, critic, and contributor to the paper's Sunday magazine. While at the Globe, Mcdonald became the first member of the major media to write against the Vietnam War. Mcdonald was also among the first American journalists to write in support of civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights. For these efforts, he has received humanitarian and people's rights awards. In 1974, Mcdonald introduced the character I. M. Fletcher, who would become an iconic figure in American popular culture, in his book Fletch. This work won the 1975 Edgar Allan Poe award from the Mystery Writers of America. In 1976, Mcdonald published its sequel, Confess, Fletch, which won the Edgar in 1977, marking the only time the award has gone to a novel and its sequel. Mcdonald's books are comprised mostly of dialogue. A self-described post-cinematic writer, he believes that readers have been exposed to so many images through movies that long, descriptive passages are unnecessary to set scenes. This is only one of many aspects of Mcdonald's writing that make his books unique and groundbreaking.With his signature character Fletch, Gregory Mcdonald created one of the best-known figures in crime fiction. Sexy, smart (some might say too smart for his own good), witty, and resourceful, Fletch finds himself in and out of predicaments that your average guy would avoid like the plague. The nine Fletch novels, originally published between 1974 and 1986, have been one of the most successful mystery series of all time, selling 100 million copies worldwide. They were also the basis of two successful films starring Chevy Chase. In addition to the Fletch series, Gregory Mcdonald is the author of numerous other mystery novels, including two Son of Fletch novels and three featuring Inspector F. X. Flynn. William Dufris began his audio career doing radio plays, audiobooks, film/animation dubbing, and language tapes in London, where he lived for thirteen years. While there, he had the honor of sharing the microphone in a number of BBC Radio plays with Kathleen Turner, Sharon Gless, Stockard Channing, and Helena Bonham-Carter. These experiences led him to cofound two audio production companies: The Story Circle Ltd. and Mind's Eye Productions. He has also acted on stage and television in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. William is the original voice of Bob (and Farmer Pickles/Mr. Beasley/Mr. Sabatini) in the popular children's show Bob the Builder for the United States and Canada (Series 1&#x2013;9). He produces, directs, acts and engineers for his audio theatre company, Rocky Coast Radio Theatre. He has been nominated nine times as a finalist for the APA's prestigious Audie Award and has garnered twenty-one Earphones Awards from AudioFile magazine, which also named him one of the Best Voices at the End of the Century, as well as one of the Best Voices of the Year in 2008 and 2009.1<br><br>"Did I ask to see you?"<br><br>"No, Frank, I--"<br><br>"I want to see you anyway." Frank Jaffe, The Editor, refolded the competing newspaper, the <i>Chronicle-Gazette</i>, and put it under his elbow on the desk. "I have some tough things to say to you."<br><br>"Little ol' me?"<br><br>"How would you like lifting a shovel eight hours a day, every day, five days a week, maybe half-days Saturdays?"<br><br>Fletch looked at his sneakers on the rug of Frank's office. Through the top of his left sneaker he saw the knuckles of three toes. Only the smallest toe showed through the top of his right sneaker. "It's not what I see for myself in the parade of life, Frank."<br><br>"That's what I see for you. In the parade of life, what do you see yourself suited for?"<br><br>"Journalism."<br><br>"And what's journalism, young Fletcher?"<br><br>"Developing the skill of ending sentences with prepositions? Especially questions?"<br><br>"Did I just do that?" Behind his thick lenses, Frank's watery eyes moved across the top of his messy desk. "I just did that."<br><br>"Frank, what I wanted to see you about--"<br><br>Frank opened a folder on his desk. "I've dug out your personnel file." The folder was not thick. "You're suited for journalism, or pick-and-shovel work. I wonder which it will be?"<br><br>"Why are you looking at my personnel file? You hired me months ago."<br><br>"Three months ago. Do you remember why? I don't."<br><br>"Because I can be really good, Frank. I--"<br><br>"I think I had the idea this newspaper needed a breath of fresh air, young maverick who would shake things up a bit, see things differently, maybe, jerk people out of their ruts."<br><br>"How can I do that, Frank, if you won't give me a job?"<br><br>"I've given you a job. Lots of jobs."<br><br>"Not a real job."<br><br>"First, I put you on the copy desk."<br><br>"Writing headlines is for poets, Frank."<br><br>"And kept you there, over the growing protests of your co-workers, I might add--"<br><br>"I spilled orange soda on somebody's terminal keyboard."<br><br>"That's not all you did."<br><br>"I made it up to him. I bought him a pair of surgical gloves.<br><br>"--until you wrote the headline GOVERNOR JOKES ON PURPOSE."<br><br>"I thought that was news."<br><br>"And somehow the headline appeared in two editions before being killed."<br><br>"Sheer poetry, Frank. Not long-lived poetry, I admit, not deathless poetry, but--"<br><br>"So then I assigned you to writing obituaries."<br><br>"You know I want to write sports, Frank. That's why I came in to see you this morning."<br><br>"Not the toughest job in the world, writing obituaries. You answer the phone, listen politely, sometimes you have to check a few facts."<br><br>"I'm very good at checking facts."<br><br>Frank held up a piece of paper. His hand quivered and his eyes shook as he read the first paragraph from it. " 'Ruth Mulholland died peacefully today, having accomplished nothing in her fifty-six years.' Did you write that?"<br><br>"It was a fact, Frank. I checked."<br><br>"Fletcher, one of the points in your writing obituaries is in our being able to print them."<br><br>"I kept asking her sister, <i>What did she ever do?</i> The sister kept talking. But I was listening, you see. This person, Ruth Mulholland, never graduated from anywhere, never got married, never had a baby, never held a job, never even supported herself. I mean, in fifty-six years she never accomplished a damned thing. Finally, I asked the sister, Did she ever make anybody a sweater? Cook a pan of brownies for anybody? Or even for herself? The sister kept saying, No, no, in fact Ruthie never did a damned thing in her life. I said, Well, is that what I should print? And the sister said, Well, yes, I guess that's the truth about Ruthie. I checked the facts, Frank. Ruthie never applied for Social Security, or a driver's license; she didn't even support her local beauty shop!"<br><br>"Fletcher--"<br><br>"What, there's not supposed to be any truth in obituaries? When someone has won the Nobel Prize we print that in an obituary. When someone accomplishes exactly nothing in life, why don't we print that? Doing absolutely nothing is a statement, Frank, a response to life. It's news, it's interesting."<br><br>"Ruthie didn't get her obituary printed, either." Frank held up another shaking piece of paper. "So you were assigned to writing wedding announcements. That's just a job of taking dictation. You don't even have to be responsible for the main fact, the wedding, because it hasn't taken place yet. Your very first announcement read, 'Sarah and Roland Jameson, first cousins, are to be married Wednesday in a ceremony restricted to family.' "<br><br>"Crisp."<br><br>"Crisp," Frank agreed.<br><br>"Concise."<br><br>"Concise."<br><br>"To the point."<br><br>"Absolutely to the point."<br><br>"And," Fletch said, "factual."<br><br>"Took talent, to dig that story out."<br><br>"Not much. When the mother of the bride called, I simply asked her why both the bride and groom had the same last name."<br><br>"And she answered you without hesitation?"<br><br>"She hesitated."<br><br>"She said they were first cousins?"<br><br>"She said their fathers were brothers."<br><br>"And neither the bride nor the groom was adopted, right?"<br><br>"Frank, I checked. What do you think I am?"<br><br>"I think you're an inexperienced journalist."<br><br>"If the rules of journalism apply on political and crime and sports pages, why don't they apply on obituaries and wedding-announcement pages? Newspapers are supposed to tell both sides of a story, right? Pah! Sundays we devote pages and pages to wedding announcements. Why don't we give equal space to divorce announcements?"<br><br>"Fletcher--"<br><br>"News is news, Frank."<br><br>"You think that by writing obituaries and wedding announcements in this heavy-handed, factual way is how you re going to get yourself assigned to the sports pages, is that it?"<br><br>"Truth is truth, Frank."<br><br>"Someday, Fletcher, may you be a victim of someone like yourself.'' Through his pupils dipped in clam juice, Frank looked at Fletcher. "You're getting married Saturday?"<br><br>"Yes. Next Saturday."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Barbara has the day open."<br><br>"Unless the purpose is to have children," Frank said slowly, "marriage is a legal institution guaranteeing only that you get screwed by lawyers."<br><br>"You don't believe in true love?"<br><br>"True Love ran at Saratoga Saturday. Made a strong start, faded fast, and ended at the back of the pack. I suppose you expect time off, for a honeymoon?"<br><br>"Barbara's rather counting on it. That's another thing I wanted to see you about."<br><br>"You haven't worked here a year yet. In fact, some say you haven't worked here at all yet!"<br><br>"Yeah, but, Frank, how many times in life do you have a honeymoon?"<br><br>"Don't ask. Why are you so sunburned?"<br><br>"I ran in the Sardinal Race yesterday."<br><br>"Your hair looks like it hasn't crossed the finish line yet."<br><br>Fletch smiled. "There's a story there."<br><br>"In your hair? I'd believe anything is in your hair."<br><br>"In the race. Do you know about the Ben Franklyn Friend Service?"<br><br>"Guess I don't."<br><br>"Basically, it's a company specializing in health and prostitution."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You call them and this sultry voice answers, saying, 'Ben Franklyn Friend Service. You want a friend?' Only sometimes she slurs a little, and it sounds more like, 'You want to, friend?' "<br><br>"You call them often?"<br><br>"The guys on the desk played a joke on me one night. They told me to phone out for pizzas and that was the number they gave me. The girl on the phone was trying to set up an appointment for me, and I kept asking if she had anchovies and pepperoni. I guess she thought I was a pervert. You ought to call them sometime."<br><br>"I need a friend."<br><br>"So I looked into 'em. Big business. Beautiful girls. All of 'em in great physical condition. They're made to work out, you know?"<br><br>"What's the story?"<br><br>"They were running yesterday. In the race. All of 'em. A flotilla of call girls. About twelve of them, all together. Running through the city streets. Downtown. Wearing T-shirts that read in front, You WANT A FRIEND?, and in back, BEN FRANKLYN. They all made it to the finish, too."<br><br>"So what's the story? Don't tell me. I've got it." Frank put his hands to his forehead. "STREETWALKERS JOG--"<br><br>"Joggle."<br><br>"CALL GIRLS COME RUNNING?"<br><br>"Consider their leg muscles, Frank."<br><br>"I'm all excited."<br><br>"They were advertising their business, Frank."<br><br>"So where did you finish in this race?"<br><br>"Right behind them. I was following a story, you might say."<br><br>"Faithful to the last."<br><br>"You're not getting the point."<br><br>"I'm not?"<br><br>"These call girls were using a city-run health and sports event to advertise their service.''<br><br>"So a few prostitutes ran in the city footrace yesterday. Why shouldn't they? Not against the law. They wore T-shirts advertising their services. Gave thrills to a few dirty old men leg-watchers standing on the curbs. So where's the story?"<br><br>"You ran pictures of them today. On your sports pages. Coming and going. Front and back."<br><br>Frank paled. "We did?"<br><br>"<i>You</i> did."<br><br>"Jeez!" Frank grabbed the <i>News-Tribune</i> off the floor and turned to the sports pages. "We did."<br><br>"There's the story."<br><br>"You mean, we're the story."<br><br>"Gave a call-girl service a nice big spread. Lots of free publicity. Have you heard from the archbishop yet? How about the district attorney? Any of your advertisers object?"<br><br>"Damn. Someone did this on purpose."<br><br>"You need me on the sports pages, Frank."<br><br>"Look at the caption. Oh, my God. <i>Physical beauty and stamina exemplified by employees of the Ben Franklyn Service Company who ran together yesterday in the city's Sardinal Race. Group finished near end of race</i> . . . I can't stand it."<br><br>"They weren't in any hurry."<br><br>"Neither were you, apparently."<br><br>"You were just telling me never to get ahead of my story."<br><br>"Get up and come into the office early Monday morning . . ." Frank was tearing through the competing newspaper, the <i>Chronicle-Gazette</i>, on his desk, trying to find the sports pages. ". . . Have to waste the damned day firing people . . ."<br><br>"The <i>Gazette</i> didn't run pictures of the call girls, Frank. Front or back. They just ran pictures of the winners. Jeez, they practice tired old journalism over there.''<br><br>Frank sat back in his chair. He looked like a boxer between rounds. "Why did I have to start off the week by seeing you?"<br><br>"Bring a little freshness to your life. A few laughs. Shake you up a bit. Make you see a few things differently, like a couple of photos on your sports pages.''<br><br>"You own a necktie?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"I've never seen it."<br><br>"It's holding one end of my surfboard off the floor."<br><br>"I suppose you're serious. What's holding up the other end?"<br><br>Fletch looked down at the top of his jeans. "A belt someone gave me."<br><br>"I decided over the weekend to give you one more chance." Frank looked at his watch.<br><br>"You're going to try me out as a sportswriter!"<br><br>"No. After all, what companies do is expect youth, energy, and experience all from the same person. That's not fair."<br><br>"The police beat? Fine!"<br><br>"Thought we might try knocking a few of the rough edges off you."<br><br>"City Hall? I can do it.

Seeing you're so quick to identify deceased people who never accomplished a damned thing in their lives, and point out to the public first cousins who intend to marry each other, I think you might have a little talent for covering society."<br><br>"You mean society, like in high society?"<br><br>"High society, low society, you know, lifestyles: all those features that cater to the anxieties of our middle-class readers."<br><br>"Frank, I don't believe in society."<br><br>"That's okay, Fletch.

No invasion of their privacy, no intrusion into their personal lives."<br><br>"Frank, would you mind if I sit down?"<br><br>"Help yourself.

Fletcher, to do an arm's length, hands off, veddy, veddy polite story about some for--God's--sake society couple who are giving five million pieces of tissue paper to the art museum?"<br><br>"Polite, yes. Why not polite? Here are a couple of people doing something nice for the world, sharing their wealth. Curb your need to report Mrs. Habeck slips vodka into her tea. Time you learned how to be polite. By the way, I can't see you over the edge of the desk."<br><br>"I disappeared."<br><br>"Well, you'd better reappear. You're meeting with Habeck in the publisher's office at ten o'clock. Pity your necktie and belt are holding up your surfboard."<br><br>"God! Any story which starts with the reporter meeting the subject in the publisher's office isn't worth getting up for."<br><br>"See? You're improving as a journalist already. You just ended a sentence with a preposition."<br><br>"I won't do it."<br><br>"Fletch, I'm pretty sure you'd be just as attractive working a pick and shovel in the city streets. You wouldn't have to wear a necktie, belt, or comb your hair. I can arrange to have you leave here Friday and you and Lucy can take as long a honeymoon as you can afford."<br><br>"Might make a nice weekend. And her name's Barbara."<br><br>"I thought so. Sunday bliss with Barbara. Tuesday with blisters."<br><br>"Frank, why don't you let Habeck write the story himself? He's paying five million dollars for the privilege."<br><br>Hamm Starbuck stuck his head around the office door. He looked at Fletch sitting cross-legged on the rug. "It's that kind of morning, is it?"<br><br>"So far," Frank answered. "Floored one. After glancing at certain photos on the sports page, I see I have a few more to floor today."<br><br>"Frank, were you expecting Donald Habeck?"<br><br>"Not me. John's expecting him. He should be sent to the publisher's office."<br><br>"He'll never make it."<br><br>"He telephoned?"<br><br>"No. He's dead in the parking lot."<br><br>Frank asked, "What do you mean?"<br><br>"In a dark blue Cadillac Seville. Bullet hole in his temple."<br><br>Fletch sprang off the floor without using his hands. "My story!"<br><br>"Guess we should call the police."<br><br>"Get the photographers down there first," Frank said.<br><br>''Already done that.''<br><br>"Also Biff Wilson.

An expert and author on magic, extrasensory perception, and the hereafter, Christopher lectured at colleges and universities and was at the forefront of the magic world from the 1950s until his death, at 70, in 1984.Feared as the devil's handiwork in medieval Europe, officially outlawed in the British colonies of North America, magic performances nevertheless attracted steadily widening audiences who marveled at the sleight of hand or sought proof of the existence of supernatural forces. First published in 1973 and long out of print, this mesmerizing, intelligent history sweeps from the earliest known image of a conjuring feat?an Egyptian wall painting made around 2500 B.C.?to the feats of that renowned escapologist Harry Houdini. In between, the authors introduce us to Muslim traveler Ibn Batuta's 1355 eyewitness account of an Indian rope trick in a Chinese royal court and to the exploits of trailblazers like French virtuoso Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, British showman Signor Antonio Blitz and Victorian entertainment producer John Nevil Maskelyne. This updated edition also covers contemporaries such as Doug Henning, Siegfried &amp; Roy, David Copperfield and Las Vegas star Melinda Saxe. Among the 300 illustrations (plus eight pages in color) are posters, ads, photos, engravings, cartoons and playbills. Milbourne Christopher, who died in 1984, was a professional magician, lecturer and historian. Maurine Christopher is his widow. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Roots Of Coincidence</h2><p>The author examines recent developments in parapsychological research and explains their implications for physicists</p><p></p><h2>Away in a Manger: A Molly Murphy Mystery (Molly Murphy Mysteries, 15)</h2><p><p>It's Christmastime in 1905 New York City, and for once, Molly Murphy Sullivan is looking forward to the approaching holidays. She has a family of her own now: she and Daniel have a baby son and twelve-year-old Bridie is living with them as their ward. As Molly and the children listen to carolers in the street, they hear a lovely voice, the voice of an angel, and see a beggar girl huddled in a doorway, singing "Away in a Manger." Bridie is touched by the girl's ragged clothes and wants to help her out if they can. They give her a quarter, only to watch a bigger boy take it from her. But Molly discovers the boy is the girl's older brother. They've come from England and their mother has disappeared, and they're living with an aunt who mistreats them terribly.</p><p>Molly quickly realizes that these children are not the usual city waifs. They are well-spoken and clearly used to better things. So who are they? And what's happened to their mother?

For many people, it must be one or the other. How can we read the Bible both ways?<br><br><em>The Bible and the Believer</em> brings together three distinguished biblical scholars--one Jewish, one Catholic, and one Protestant--to illustrate how to read the Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament critically and religiously. Marc Zvi Brettler, Peter Enns, and Daniel J. Harrington tackle a dilemma that not only haunts biblical scholarship today, but also disturbs students and others exposed to biblical criticism for the first time, either in university courses or through their own reading. Failure to resolve these conflicting interpretive strategies often results in rejection of either the critical approach or the religious approach--or both. But the authors demonstrate how biblical criticism--the process of establishing the original contextual meaning of biblical texts with the tools of literary and historical analysis--need not undermine religious interpretations of the Bible, but can in fact enhance them. They show how awareness of new archeological evidence, cultural context, literary form, and other tools of historical criticism can provide the necessary preparation for a sound religious reading. And they argue that the challenges such study raises for religious belief should be brought into conversation with religious tradition rather than deemed grounds for dismissing either that tradition or biblical criticism. <br><br>Guiding readers through the history of biblical exegesis within the Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant faith traditions, <em>The Bible and the Believer</em> bridges an age-old gap between critical and religious approaches to the Old Testament.</p><p><br><strong>Marc Zvi Brettler</strong> is the Dora Golding Professor of Biblical Studies at Brandeis University.

A worthwhile book for all who take the Bible seriously."--James Kugel, author of How to Read the Bible<p><br>"Arguing that historical analysis informs rather than compromises the Bible's religious significance, Brettler, Harrington, and Enns show how the Scriptures of Israel continue to speak, in both complementary and distinct ways, to Jews, Protestants, and Roman Catholics.

Liz Stephens has little interest in attending a USO club dance with her friends Betty and Julia. She doesn't need a flirtation with a lonely serviceman when she's set to marry her childhood sweetheart. Yet something happens the moment Liz glimpses Morgan McClain. They share only a brief exchange--cut short by the soldier's evident interest in Betty--but Liz can't forget him. Thus, when Betty asks her to ghostwrite a letter to Morgan, stationed overseas, Liz reluctantly agrees.<br><br>Thousands of miles away, Morgan struggles to adjust to the brutality of war. His letters from "Betty" are a comfort, their soul-baring correspondence a revelation to them both. While Liz is torn by her feelings for a man who doesn't know her true identity, Betty and Julia each become immersed in their own romantic entanglements. And as the war draws to a close, all three will face heart-wrenching choices, painful losses, and the bittersweet joy of new beginnings.&nbsp;<br><br>Beautifully rendered and deeply moving,&nbsp;<i>Letters from Home</i>&nbsp;is a story of hope and connection, of sacrifices made in love and war--and the chance encounters that change us forever.</p><p>It all started with a family Christmas gift.&nbsp;That was my sole intent, anyhow, when I self-published a cookbook several years ago featuring recipes my grandmother had collected and created over several decades.

She then&nbsp;retrieved from her closet a beautiful stack of courtship letters, a collection no one in the family knew existed. I needed to read only a few pages of his script, as elegant as his words despite the "plow jockey's" youth, to understand the reason she so readily said, "I do."<br>Long after the cookbook was complete, I continued to ponder their era, one charged with romance, tragedy, uncertainty, and loss of innocence. A time of self-discovery, sacrifice, and female independence. Intrigued by this dramatic setting, and with my grandfather's correspondence lingering in my mind, I found myself wondering how different the couple's relationship would have been had their letters been woven with fibers of deception.&nbsp;Therein bloomed the idea for my first novel, <i>Letters from Home.&nbsp;</i>I hope the book touches your heart as much as my grandpa's letters have touched mine!<i><br>For unique 1940s recipes and a discussion guide, actual excerpts from my grandfather's letters, or to schedule a personal visit with your book club (in person/phone/Skype), please visit my website.

Bound in sturdy imitation black leather, it combines extra-large print, a convenient 5 x 8 size, and a great price in one package. The only bible of its type available today, this highly portable volume is perfect for commuters, hospital visitors, and witnessing.</p><p>With an introduction by Bono.<p>Among the best known and most quoted books of the Old Testament, the <i>Book of Psalms</i> contains some 150 hymns of praise, prayers of crisis, and songs of faith once attributed solely to the Biblical King David. It is now believed that this collection of poems, originally chanted or sung with instrumental accompaniment, reflects Israel's entire history from the period of the exodus (13th century B.C.) to the postexilic restoration (after 600 B.C.), and we cherish them as the expressions of faith of many generations and many peoples.<br>The <i>Book of Psalms</i> is shared by all sections of Judaism and Christianity, and is fundamental to both Christian and Jewish liturgies. Its English translation in the King James Version of the Bible (1611), from which this edition is reprinted complete and unabridged, is an exceptionally beautiful and stirring one, long regarded as a classic of English literature.</p><p></p></p><h2>Lucky</h2><p>In a memoir hailed for its searing candour and wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was utterly transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. What propels this chronicle of her recovery is Sebold&#39;s indomitable spirit as she struggles for understanding (&#39;After telling the hard facts to anyone, from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes&#39;); as her dazed family and friends sometimes bungle their efforts to provide comfort and support; and as, ultimately, she triumphs, managing through grit and coincidence to help secure her attacker&#39;s arrest and conviction. In a narrative by turns disturbing, thrilling, and inspiring, Alice Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims even as she imparts wisdom profoundly hard-won: &#39;You save yourself or you remain unsaved&#39;. &#34;A rueful, razor-sharp memoir...Sebold tells what it&#39;s like to go through a particular kind of nightmare in order to tell what it&#39;s like slowly, bumpily, triumphantly to heal&#34;. (Sarah Kerr, &#34;Vogue&#34;).</p><p>Enormously visceral, emotionally gripping, and imbued with the belief that justice is possible even after the most horrific of crimes, Alice Sebold's compelling memoir of her rape at the age of eighteen is a story that takes hold of you and won't let go.<p>Sebold fulfills a promise that she made to herself in the very tunnel where she was raped: someday she would write a book about her experience. With Lucky she delivers on that promise with mordant wit and an eye for life's absurdities, as she describes what she was like both as a young girl before the rape and how that rape changed but did not sink the woman she later became.</p><p>It is Alice's indomitable spirit that we come to know in these pages. The same young woman who sets her sights on becoming an Ethel Merman -- style diva one day (despite her braces, bad complexion, and extra weight) encounters what is still thought of today as the crime from which no woman can ever really recover. In an account that is at once heartrending and hilarious, we see Alice's spirit prevail as she struggles to have a normal college experience in the aftermath of this harrowing, life-changing event.</p><p>No less gripping is the almost unbelievable role that coincidence plays in the unfolding of Sebold's narrative. Her case, placed in the inactive file, is miraculously opened again six months later when she sees her rapist on the street. This begins the long road to what dominates these pages: the struggle for triumph and understanding -- in the courtroom and outside in the world.</p><p>Lucky is, quite simply, a real-life thriller. In its literary style and narrative tension we never lose sight of why this life story is worth reading.

Walking Off My Tired Feet"<br><br>The week before rehearsals begin, January 3-8<br><br>Over the New Year's weekend (1971) I got a phone call from production stage manager Fritz Holt. He asked whether I could show up at the studio at ten a.m. on Sunday, January 3rd. I didn't think rehearsals were to begin for another week, but since I was just hanging around at home, I agreed. The show was rehearsing at the American Theater Lab, which filled the entire second floor of a two-story building on West Nineteenth Street, just off Seventh Avenue, above a tire shop. It had been created for Jerome Robbins, one of America's most talented choreographers and directors, who wanted to experiment with a European-style workshop. The experiment didn't work, but it left a workable space in which Harold Prince liked to rehearse his shows. The quarters were spare, but more than adequate: one large rehearsal room big enough to represent an entire Broadway stage; a second room half its size, large enough for dance rehearsals; and a third one even smaller, for music. Support facilities included a couple of offices in the front, changing rooms in the back, and a commons room with some slightly ratty sofas and chairs.<br><br>Few people were around when I arrived. As I came up the stairs I heard a piano and a number of feet thumping a steady rhythm. I reported to the first open door I came to-the production stage manager's office, where Fritz Holt greeted me as "our production assistant." First day, first defeat-or so I thought. "Production assistant" is the theater euphemism for "gofer," and that's not what this experience was supposed to be. Sure, I had done it twice before, and enjoyed it both times. But this was to be different; even though I had agreed to be a general assistant to Ruth Mitchell, this time I simply wanted to observe the process. That's also how I had sold it to Connecticut College, which was giving me credit for observing a show being assembled. I hadn't proposed an independent study of fetching coffee and sandwiches. The journal I agreed to keep would show an observer's objective eye, not the musings of an errand boy, so when I heard myself referred to as the "production assistant," my heart sank. But in short order I realized I was wrong. While I still had plenty of time to observe, being the gofer gave me a real position, albeit a minor one, within the company. It also, frankly, gave me things to do, and as the weeks went on, I ended up with some pretty responsible tasks, including maintaining up-to-date scripts with all the constantly changing dialogue and lyrics. I was made to feel a part of the experience, and felt accepted by the company in a way I might not have been had I just been watching. And being the gofer gave me license to wander into rehearsals without people feeling as if a stranger were in their midst. It provided a great position from which to observe the goings-on.<br><br>Fritz introduced me to the two other stage managers: first assistant and dance captain George Martin, a lithe and tidy, well-groomed gray-haired dancer who seemed a model of efficiency and discretion; and second assistant John Grigas, an ex-dancer, somewhat older, stern faced, and with a caustic quip for every situation. Clearly not a man to cross. His first words to me were: "We want you to go out and get us some coffee." So I pulled out my pad, took the orders, and out I went. If a job is worth doing, I figured, it's worth doing well-and I had learned during my first gofer experience that in New York, "regular" coffee means coffee with milk and sugar, not "regular" as in plain. There is no such thing as plain-black means black, regular means regular, and those who prefer regular are sorely disappointed to open a cardboard cup and find black liquid inside. I'd made that mistake.<br><br>A musical as large as Follies needed its three stage managers. Fritz Holt, as production stage manager, was ultimately the boss of the stage and everything behind the curtain. It was his responsibility to schedule the overall rehearsal period and to coordinate all technical aspects of the production. He was also the liaison with the shops-costume, props, scenery-and with all the other support personnel who were contributing to the show. During the rehearsals, he would stay with Hal in the large room whenever possible, marking down the blocking and scene shifts in his master script. It would become the map by which the show would be run once in the theater, and since he would be responsible for all understudy and brush-up rehearsals, his script needed to be up to date and accurate. George Martin, as dance captain, would stay with Michael, and he would notate the dances, both as a reminder of what had happened in prior rehearsals as well as to create a choreographic map for the whole show. John Grigas was stationed in the office, and so became the conduit for company problems and concerns. He was also assigned the small acting role of a chauffeur. Once the show got assembled onstage, Fritz would call the show from the stage managers' desk on stage right, George would man his desk on stage left, and John would float backstage and assist any performer who needed guidance or a helping hand.<br><br>During rehearsals, the stage managers were clearly in charge of logistics. Schedules were their responsibility, not only of who would be using which room, but who would be needed for what rehearsal. As I was shown around, each room's use was described to me. Today the midsized rehearsal room was Michael Bennett's domain, as evidenced by the sounds of dance rehearsals already in progress. The music room was empty, with only a piano and a couple of chairs placed about. When we got to the large rehearsal room, John said, ". . . and this is where Mr. Prince will be working, so always check first with Fritz before coming in here." I was shown where I should park myself in the common hallway while waiting for tasks, always making myself available, never in anyone's way, but near the bulletin board and the pay phone. "Get yourself a clipboard and always be poised for action," he said. The whole place looked organized, and the stage managers' office was most organized of all-desk, typewriter, phone, cups of pens and pencils, stacks of current scripts, neat piles of music, etc. There was also a two-drawer filing cabinet. "This is where Mr. Prince keeps his stuff," John said, and then, pointing to the lower drawer, ". . . and this is where he keeps his Courvoisier." (It wasn't Courvoisier; it was Fernet-Branca, a digest if that had been recommended to Hal as a cure for his anxiety-prone gut, or what he referred to as "JBS-Jewish Boy Stomach." Once he found out it contained alcohol, he stopped having it around.)<br><br>Through the wall I heard a piano playing one particular section of one song over and over while several voices sang, repeatedly: "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the saddest gal in town?" The dancers were working with Michael Bennett and his long-time assistant Bob Avian. John Berkman, the dance-music arranger, was at the keyboard. Paul Gemignani, the show's percussionist, was at the trap set. "Who's That Woman?" was being created. More on that later.<br><br>Harold Prince arrived at noon. He greeted me warmly and said that the day before, he had turned to his ever-present associate Ruth Mitchell-called Ruthie by one and all-and said: "Where's Ted? Get him down here now, for God's sake. We can always keep him busy!" The place seemed far too empty for Hal; he was anxious to get rehearsals going. He wandered around, trying to find things to do. Walking into the empty large rehearsal room, the one I had been told would be his, he said, "I just want to start! Give me some actors, please!" Outlines of the intricately tiered set had been taped out on the floor; it passed his inspection. By week's end there would be movable platforms approximating the levels of the set, but for now the traditional masking tape would have to do. Back in the stage managers' office, he pulled out a transparency of the poster for the show and proudly taped it to the window, declaring it to be "the best poster I have ever had." Colorful and striking, it had been created by David Byrd, a longhaired young artist whose distinctive style was first noticed in his psychedelic poster for the Fillmore East-sometimes called nouveau art nouveau. He had walked into Hal's office one day and said, "I want to do posters for you." Hal said, "Sure," and luckily his initial take on Follies led to this artwork, which both Hal and the advertising agency felt was the best idea presented. It bore a superficial resemblance to his poster for Godspell, with one central face as the focal point. But the figure in Follies was bolder and more striking, an austere face with droopy and prominent eyelids-presumably a woman-looking up and out, wearing the rest of the poster, including the bold lettering proclaiming the title of the show, as if it were a headdress. (A stark black-and-white photograph of Marlene Dietrich was said to be an inspiration.) Running from her lower right cheek, across her stone face and continuing up her left cheek through the "E" of "FOLLIES," was a long, widening crack. Something was clearly amiss in the image of this American icon. The colors were very strong, with shades of orange in the space below where all the credits would ultimately go, and dark blues at the top with nighttime stars shining through. The long hair was drawn with pop-art detail, similar to the Godspell poster but in vivid colors, and around the outside was a border of orange and blue. It seemed appropriate, yet very strong.<br><br>With only one dance number actually in rehearsal, Hal didn't know what to do. He tried to get in touch with anyone he could find via phone. First was Florence Klotz, the costume designer. "Where is she? She could be designing a costume now and could bring a sketch down at the ...</p><h2>Mishkan HaNefesh: Machzor for the Days of Awe, 2 Vol Set (2015-05-03)</h2><p>Mishkan HaNefesh: Machzor for the Days of Awe offers meaningful liturgy for both regular service attendees and those new to Jewish spirituality and practice.

They would have struck up lively conversations, attempting to persuade their colleagues to accept one proposal or another, their animated faces reflecting off the room&#x2019;s varnished chestnut paneling. But tonight, pulled away from their evening activities, they wore sports slacks and shirts, their hair wet and windblown, their faces grim as they sat quietly in their seats, eyes fixed on the man at the head of the U-shaped conference table. <br>Beads of rain clung to Levi Rosenfeld&#x2019;s Windbreaker, left there by a spring storm that had settled over the Middle East, expending itself in unbridled fury, sheets of rain descending in cascading torrents. Prime Minister Rosenfeld, flanked by all twelve members of Israel&#x2019;s National Security Council, fumed silently in his seat as he awaited details of an unprecedented threat to his country&#x2019;s existence. He wondered how such critical information could have been discovered so late. At the far left of the conference table sat Barak Kogen, Israel&#x2019;s intelligence minister. Although Kogen was not a member of the Security Council, Rosenfeld had directed him to attend tonight&#x2019;s meeting to explain the Mossad&#x2019;s failure. <br>At the front of the room, a man stood before a large flat-screen monitor. Thin and short, wearing round wire-rimmed glasses, Ehud Rabin&#x2019;s physical presence failed to reflect the power he wielded as the leader of Israel&#x2019;s second-strongest political party and as Israel&#x2019;s defense minister. Ehud waited for Rosenfeld&#x2019;s permission to begin. <br>Rosenfeld nodded in his direction. <br>Pushing his glasses onto the bridge of his nose, Ehud stated what everyone in the room already knew. &#x201c;The Mossad reports Iran will complete assembly of its first nuclear weapon in ten days.&#x201d; The lights in the conference room flickered, thunder rumbling in the distance as if on cue. <br>Rosenfeld looked at his intelligence minister. &#x201c;Why did we discover this just now, only days before they complete assembly?&#x201d; <br>Kogen shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his eyes scanning each member of the Security Council before coming to rest on Rosenfeld. &#x201c;I apologize, Prime Minister. Nothing is more important than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But Iran has deceived us and the rest of the world. We were fortunate to discover the true extent of their progress in time. We will be more vigilant in the future.&#x201d; <br>There was something about Kogen&#x2019;s quick apology rather than stout defense of his Mossad that gave Rosenfeld the impression he was hiding something. But perhaps the evening&#x2019;s tension was clouding his intuition. He turned back to Ehud. &#x201c;What are our options?&#x201d; <br>Ehud pressed a remote control in his hand, stepping aside as the monitor flickered to life, displaying a map of Iran. &#x201c;Weapon assembly is occurring at the Natanz nuclear complex.&#x201d; A flashing red circle appeared two hundred kilometers south of Tehran. &#x201c;Uranium for additional weapons is being enriched at Isfahan, and plutonium is being produced at their heavy-water plant near Arak.&#x201d; Two more red circles appeared in central Iran. &#x201c;Eliminating the facilities at Arak and Isfahan will be easy, but destruction of their weapon assembly complex at Natanz will be impossible with a conventional strike.&#x201d; The map zoomed in on the Natanz facility, a sprawling collection of innocuous-looking buildings. &#x201c;Iran has built a hardened complex beneath the Karkas mountains, connected to the main facility by tunnels. While a conventional strike will collapse the tunnels, it cannot destroy the weapon assembly complex.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So how do we destroy this facility?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Since the complex cannot be destroyed with conventional weapons, that leaves one option.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld leaned forward in his chair. &#x201c;What are you proposing?&#x201d; <br>Ehud glared at the prime minister. &#x201c;You know exactly what needs to be done here, Levi. We have a responsibility to protect the citizens of our country. There is no question this weapon will be used against us, either directly or indirectly. We <i>must</i> destroy this facility before Iran completes assembly of this bomb, even if that means we have to employ one of <i>our</i> nuclear weapons.&#x201d; <br>The conference room erupted. Some council members passionately agreed with Ehud while others chastised him for proposing such an egregious break in policy. Rosenfeld slammed his fist on the table, silencing the room. &#x201c;Out of the question! We will not use nuclear weapons unless they are used against us first.&#x201d; <br>Ehud&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Then millions of our people will die, because Iran <i>will</i> use this weapon against us. We can either strike now, before our men, women, and children are murdered, or afterward. If we do not strike first, their deaths will be on your conscience.&#x201d; <br>The defense minister&#x2019;s assertion hung in the air as Rosenfeld surveyed his council members, some of them staring back, others with their eyes to the table. Whether they agreed with Ehud or not, they could not avoid the underlying truth. <br>If Iran assembled this weapon, it would eventually be used against Israel. That was something Israel could not allow. But a nuclear first strike! Although the prime minister and his Security Council had the authority to authorize the use of nuclear weapons, morally&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Rosenfeld looked down one side of the conference table and then the other, examining the faces of the men and women seated around him, eventually returning his attention to Ehud. &#x201c;Are there are no conventional weapons capable of destroying this complex? Not even in the American arsenal?&#x201d; <br>Ehud&#x2019;s lips drew thin. &#x201c;The Americans have the necessary weapons. But they will not provide them to us while they engage in <i>discussions</i> with Iran.&#x201d; Ehud&#x2019;s voice dripped with disdain as he mentioned America&#x2019;s attempt to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions with mere words. <br>&#x201c;Do not discount our ally so easily,&#x201d; Rosenfeld replied. &#x201c;I will meet with the American ambassador tomorrow and explain the situation.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You are blind, Levi.&#x201d; Ehud&#x2019;s face tightened. &#x201c;The Americans have abandoned us, and you fail to recognize it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, Ehud! Provide me with the information on the weapons we need, and I will broach this with the United States.&#x201d; <br>Ehud nodded tersely. <br>Rosenfeld stood. &#x201c;Unless there is more to discuss, I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow morning.&#x201d; <br>The council members filed out of the conference room, until only Rosenfeld and Kogen remained. <br>Turning to Rosenfeld, Kogen said, &#x201c;Prime Minister, may I have a word with you, privately?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course. What would you like to discuss?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s best we not talk here.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Footsteps echoed off the gray terrazzo floor as the two men, each lost in his own thoughts, walked down the Hall of Advisers toward Rosenfeld&#x2019;s office. On their right, paintings of Israel&#x2019;s prime ministers hung in shallow alcoves, beginning with the image of their country&#x2019;s first premier, David Ben-Gurion, who guided Israel through its War of Independence. At the far end of the hallway, a conspicuous bare spot on the wall marked the location where Rosenfeld&#x2019;s portrait would someday hang. <br>Glancing at the shorter and heavier man walking beside him, Kogen thought Rosenfeld had aged more than could be attributed to the normal passage of time. But that was easily explained. Shortly after his election six years ago, the prime minister had weathered a three-year intifada. Then there was the personal loss he had endured, compounded by his dual responsibilities as father and prime minister. Yet despite the toll of his years in office, the older man walked with a determined pace and slightly forward lean, as if barreling through unseen obstacles in his path. The brisk pace was his only exercise; workouts were always something to be scheduled in the not too distant future. As a result, he had steadily added padding to his midsection. But Kogen knew Rosenfeld considered his weight acceptable as long as the circumference of his waist remained smaller than the width of his shoulders. Fortunately, Rosenfeld had broad shoulders. <br>Kogen, on the other hand, had retained his youthful physique, lean and muscular. The taller man, always impeccably dressed, he projected an air of competence and confidence. To the uninformed, Kogen was the more ideal image of a prime minister. But his service had been limited to the military and Israel&#x2019;s intelligence service; he&#x2019;d been appointed intelligence minister shortly after Rosenfeld&#x2019;s election as prime minister. <br>Reaching the end of the hallway, Rosenfeld and Kogen passed through a metal detector and into the Aquarium, the security guard&#x2019;s eyes displaying no hint of curiosity about their arrival so late on a Monday evening. The Aquarium section of the PMO, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office building, where foreign leaders visited their Israeli counterparts, contained a plush, well-appointed lobby, offices for Rosenfeld and his closest aides, and a communications center that allowed for minute-by-minute contact with the Israel Defense Forces. Kogen reflected on the many decisions Rosenfeld and previous prime ministers had made in that small room, guiding Israel through its turbulent history; decisions that paled in importance to the one that would be made tonight. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Following the prime minister into his office, Kogen sat stiffly in the chair across from Rosenfeld&#x2019;s desk, scanning the content of the modestly furnished room as he collected his thoughts. The furniture was spartan and utilitarian, the desk and chairs made from natural unstained maple, unadorned with intricate carvings. The shelf behind Rosenfeld was filled with books arranged in no particular order. The office, with its indecipherable filing system and simple furnishings, reflected the prime minister perfectly&#x2014;it was difficult to gauge his reaction to complex issues, yet straightforward once a decision was made. Although Kogen had known Rosenfeld his entire adult life, he could not predict his friend&#x2019;s response. Rosenfeld&#x2019;s decision would determine whether four years of painstaking preparation had been in vain. <br>Heavy drops of rain pelted the prime minister&#x2019;s windows as Rosenfeld waited for Kogen to speak. As impatience gathered in Rosenfeld&#x2019;s eyes, Kogen steeled himself. He cleared his throat, then began. &#x201c;We must destroy Natanz, Levi. You know better than anyone the sacrifice we will endure as a nation if Iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld glanced at the framed portrait of his family, still sitting on his desk. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not telling me anything I don&#x2019;t already know, Barak.&#x201d; <br>Lowering his voice, Kogen continued, &#x201c;Iran is a cesspool of contempt for Israel, intent on exterminating our people. Natanz <i>must</i> be destroyed before this weapon is assembled. We do not have the necessary conventional weapons. Therefore it must be destroyed with a nuclear strike.&#x201d; <br>There was a long silence as Rosenfeld contemplated Kogen&#x2019;s assertion. Finally, Rosenfeld spoke. &#x201c;I will not authorize the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. From a political and moral standpoint, that is something we cannot do.&#x201d; <br>Kogen leaned back in his chair, a sly smile emerging on his lips. &#x201c;I never said <i>Israel</i> would launch the nuclear strike.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld blinked, not comprehending Kogen&#x2019;s statement. &#x201c;Then who?&#x201d; <br>The younger man&#x2019;s smile widened. &#x201c;America.&#x201d; <br>A puzzled expression worked its way across Rosenfeld&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;America? The president would never authorize this.&#x201d; <br>Kogen hesitated a moment before continuing. It was finally time to reveal the Mossad&#x2019;s most closely held secret. &#x201c;The president&#x2019;s authorization isn&#x2019;t required, Prime Minister. Only yours. The Mossad stands ready to initiate an operation that will result in America destroying Natanz. Your authorization is the only step remaining.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld stared at Kogen for a long moment, then his eyes went to the portrait of his family again. No one understood better what was at stake than Rosenfeld, and Kogen knew he was struggling. Iran didn&#x2019;t have an army massed on Israel&#x2019;s border. They didn&#x2019;t have a nuclear arsenal in the process of being launched. Yet the threat Iran posed was severe. It had to be dealt with, and deceiving America into employing one of its nuclear weapons was the perfect solution. <br>It didn&#x2019;t take long for Rosenfeld to come to a decision. <br>&#x201c;Absolutely not!&#x201d; <br>Frustration boiled inside Kogen. Still, he harbored hope Rosenfeld would eventually come to the proper decision. The Mossad plan was a radical proposal, and the prime minister would need time to accept it. After a few days of reflection, Rosenfeld would see the wisdom in Kogen&#x2019;s solution. <br>Showing no outward sign of his frustration, Kogen stood. Before turning to leave, he said, &#x201c;In ten days, Prime Minister, Iran will complete assembly of this weapon. You have until then to decide.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Rick Campbell <br></p><h2>Churchill&#39;s Generals</h2><p>Essays discuss the lives and careers of twenty of the leading British generals of the Second World War</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettesBritain&#39;s most distinguished military historian and senior lecturer at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst for many years, Sir John Keegan is the author of THE FACE OF BATTLE, widely considered a classic of military history.

They invade the spaces they inhabit, instead of neatly complementing them. Her use of inexpensive everyday materials&#x2015;concrete, plywood, cardboard, plaster, fabric and paint&#x2015;suggests that her works are a double act of recycling: both of the materials she uses and the images she draws from her memory. With installation shots of the artist's new works at the Royal Academy, London, and photography in the studio, the book's introduction situates Barlow as a key figure within contemporary sculpture. An interview between the artist and the show's curator, Edith Devaney, examines the new work in the exhibition.</p></p><p></p><h2>Moments in Time: Photos and Stories from One of America&#39;s Top Photojournalists</h2><p>Dirck Halstead is one of America&#x2019;s preeminent photojournalists, whose iconic images have graced more covers of <i>Time</i> magazine than any other photographer&#x2019;s.

She is bringing home the Queen&#x2019;s own valuable reproduction of the &#x201c;Little Mermaid,&#x201d; the famous statue that overlooks the harbor in Copenhagen. While she is showing the Hollisters the little figurine, another passenger expresses interest in seeing this rare treasure. His interest, however, strikes the five Hollister children as being more than just enthusiasm for the beauty and workmanship of the figurine. In the excitement of preparing to land at the Copenhagen airport, he is forgotten until, upon landing, the figurine is found to be missing. From then on the Hollisters find themselves becoming more and more involved with the strange man with the beard and his rather peculiar activities. Much to the Hollisters&#x2019; surprise they find not only is the figurine an object of mystery, but the trail of the bearded man is leading them to a ring of international thieves and their search for a bejeweled treasure, hidden centuries ago. The Hollisters finally discover a clue to this treasure from the study of the history of the ship models hung in the churches of Denmark to honor lost seamen. This new Hollister story should be a fine addition to the series, since it is the first time the Hollisters have traveled outside the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>The Happy Hollisters by Jerry West was actually written by Andrew E. Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children&#x2019;s book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. He joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate as a writer in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in his own original series, The Happy Hollisters, was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone. Under various pseudonyms, Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were then worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. The children loved the stories for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>Playing For Pizza</h2><p>Format: Hardcover Publisher: Doubleday Edition: 1 ISBN-10: 0385525001 ISBN-13: 9780385525008 Subject: Action, Adventure Publication Year: 2007 Topic: -- Special Attributes: -- Language: -- Detailed item info Synopsis Bestselling author John Grisham takes a break from his usual legal thrillers and has some fun with a comic novel about American football..in Italy.

What was the inspiration for <i>Playing for Pizza</i>? <p></p> <b>A: </b>Three years ago when I was in Bologna researching "The Broker", I discovered American football. One of my guides in the area played football for the Bologna Warriors for 10 years. I couldn't believe that American football actually existed there, but the more I heard about it the more intrigued I became. <p></p> <b>Q: </b>There is some great football writing in this novel. What kind of research was involved in capturing how this American institution is played in small town Italy? <p></p> <b>A: </b>The only way to research the book was to go to Parma and watch a game. The coach is an American who played at Illinois State, and he proved to be extremely valuable. I met many of the Italian players and the story simply unfolded. <p></p> <b>Q: </b>Speaking of research, you write lovingly of Italian food and wine in this book. What's your idea of the perfect Italian meal? <p></p> <b>A: </b>First course: prosicutto and melon; second course: stuffed tortellini; third course: roasted stuffed capon, all served with a great Barolo wine. <p></p> <b>Q: </b>Without giving away too much of the plot, your protagonist falls in love by the novel's end. Did you know when you started writing that Rick would get the girl? <p></p> <b>A: </b>Of course. <p></p> <b>Q: </b>You have a new legal thriller coming in January 2008. Can you give us any hints about what to expect? <p></p> <b>A: </b>I really don't like to talk about a book until it's finished. Sorry. But it will not be another work of non-fiction, nor will it be about football. Lots of lawyers in the next one. <br><br>Since first publishing&nbsp;<b>A Time to Kill</b>&nbsp;in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are&nbsp;<b>The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror,</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>The Broker</b>) and all of them have become international bestsellers.&nbsp;<b>The Innocent Man</b>&nbsp;(October 2006) marks his first foray into non-fiction.<br><br>Grisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea.

Write your own novel, compile a personal cookbook, draw pictures, make lists, keep records, collect autographs, write poetry, plan vacations, start a diary or scrapbook, design clothes, invent needlework or knitting patterns, doodle, compose songs, jot down important dates, keep a guest book, press flowers, gather favorite quotes, accumulate (or invent) funny stories, use your imagination and do your own thing The Nothing Book is your book, it is meant to be whatever you want it to be. As Byron once wrote:<br><br>'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print; A book's a book, although there's nothing in't.</p><p></p><h2>Country Diary Herbal</h2><p>Book by Hollis, Sarah</p><p></p><h2>Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir</h2><p>Ezra Pound's book on the French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was first published in 1916. An enlarged edition, including thirty pages of illustrations (sculpture and drawings) as well as Pound's later pieces on Gaudier, was brought out in 1970, and is now re-issued as an ND Paperbook. The memoir is valuable both for the history of modern art and for what it shows us of Pound himself, his ability to recognize genius in others and then to publicize it effectively. Would there today be a Salle Gaudier-Brzeska in the Musï¿½e de L'Art Moderne in Paris if Pound had not championed him? Gaudier's talent was impressive and his Vorticist aesthetic important as theory, but he was killed in World War I at the age of twenty-three, leaving only a small body of work. Pound knew Gaudier in London, where the young artist had come with his companion, the Polish-born Sophie Brzeska. whose name he added to his own. They were living in poverty when Pound bought Gaudier the stone from which the famous "hieratic head" of the poet was made. Pound arranged exhibitions and for the publication of Gaudier's manifestoes in <em>Blast</em> and <em>The Egoist</em>. And he wrote and sent packages to him in the trenches, where Gaudier&#x2013;&#x2013;a sculptor to the last&#x2013;&#x2013;carved a madonna and child from the butt of a captured German rifle, just two days before he died.</p><p>New Directions has been the primary publisher of Ezra Pound in the U.S. since the founding of the press when James Laughlin published New Directions in Prose and Poetry 1936. That year Pound was fifty-one. In Laughlin&#x2019;s first letter to Pound, he wrote: &#x201c;Expect, please, no fireworks. I am bourgeois-born (Pittsburgh); have never missed a meal. . . . But full of &#x2018;noble caring&#x2019; for something as inconceivable as the future of decent letters in the US.&#x201d; Little did Pound know that into the twenty-first century the fireworks would keep exploding as readers continue to find his books relevant and meaningful.</p><h2>Read Aloud Treasury</h2><p>The <i>Read-Aloud Treasury</i> makes&nbsp;&nbsp;finding good children's literature easy.

However, when Gus suffers a stroke and their idyllic Mediterranean life is thrown into upheaval, it&#x2019;s left to their three grown-up children in London to step in . . . Sebastian is busy running his company with his wife, Anna, who&#x2019;s never quite seen eye-to-eye with her mother-in-law. Katie, a successful solicitor in the city, is distracted by the problems with her long-term partner, Nic, and the secretive lives of their three daughters. And Jake, ever the easy-going optimist, is determined to convince his new wife, Bella, that moving to Spain with their 18-month-old would be a good idea. As the children descend on the vineyard, it becomes clear that each has their own idea of how best to handle their mum and dad, as well as the family business. But as long-simmering resentments rise to the surface and tensions reach breaking point, can the family ties prove strong enough to keep them together?</p><p><b>Joanna Trollope</b> is the author of more than 20 previous highly acclaimed and bestselling novels, including <i>City of Friends</i>, <i>An Unsuitable Match</i>, <i>Girl from the South</i>,<i> Marrying the Mistress</i>, and <i>The Other Family</i>.

With globalization, these societies are to be prized for their distinctive lifestyles, art and traditions. They live in close harmony with nature, now a rarity in our modern era. Jimmy Nelson not only presents us with stunning images of customs and artifacts, but also offers insightful portraits of people who are the guardians of a culture that they--and we--hope will be passed on to future generations in all its glory. Nelson&#39;s large-plate field camera captures every intricate detail and fine nuance for posterity. What&#39;s more, this splendid pageantry is set against a vivid backdrop of some of the world&#39;s most pristine landscapes.

The concept is simple: these men and women took denim garments and changed them. There's a wide range of techniques here: applique, embroidery and other needlepoint techniques, distressing, intergration of other fabrics, painting, studding. The intentions of the artists here are varied. Some of them are coming straight out of the hippie "I drew on my dirty jeans" school. Others are clearly fabric artists interested in seeing how they can transform garments into something new. Some of them are fashion designers, looking to take street wear to a fashion-conscious and upscale place. And some are just pure folk artists -- "I wanted to have two naked chicks with pubic hair on my jacket so I made this." Whatever their intentions, the work exhibited in this book is remarkable. And every stereotype you might have in your head about the mid-70's being a stylistic nadir will be challenged by the groovy stuff here. Applique jeans with flowers and butterflies aren't automatically a joke. They can be an object of great beauty. Almost all color photography with many detail shots and a few fold-out pages. Interspersed are b&amp;w photos of famous people looking famous in denim (the usual suspects like Peter Fonda and Olivia Newton-John are here as well as Marlene Dietrich and Frank Sinatra wearing a truly horrendous bell-bottomed number.) Interspersed through the book is the essay by Peter Beagle which is a free-flowing and personal reflection on the spirit of the time, the fashionable past, crafting, the history of the Levi brand, life in a post-1960's realities, and how he really, really liked fur when he was a kid.

Original.</p><p>Continuing his exploration of superhero comics, Moore speculates on what would happen if an expansion in the number of people who are able to develop their desires into super powers led to the creation of Neopolis. His world is populated by superbeings: people (and animals, space aliens, robots, etc.) who have extraordinary abilities and secret identities. Basic human nature leads to an urban society resembling today's, including the need to maintain law and order among the sometimes barely controllable superbeings. Based on that premise, overlapping, intertwined stories create a kind of skewed Hill Street Blues for the cops of Top 10, the police station in Neopolis. Sometimes their cases work out farcically, but sometimes very seriously. After all, Moore asks, if you could do almost anything, what limits would you accept? What kind of responsibility would you take for others? Most comics series are intended to be endless, so nothing changes much from issue to issue. That's not so in this case; Book One is necessary reading before picking up Book Two. The art helps this purpose. Much of today's manga-influenced comics art is designed to convey excitement, using motion at the expense of detail. The artwork here reverts to an older tradition of elaborate pen and ink text illustration (like Joseph Clement Coll's work), slowing readers down just enough to make them alert to the elegant details of the world Moore has created. Anyone interested in comics should be paying attention to Moore and this outstanding example of his recent thinking. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.The comic-book series Top 10 has been described as "Hill Street Blues with superheroes." It is set in futuristic Neopolis, where every resident, from the mayor to the garbage man, has super powers. The challenge of maintaining order in such an environment falls to a constabulary that includes desk sergeant Kemlo Caesar, a talking dog in a humanoid exoskeleton; Jack Phantom, who passes through solid objects; the moody, invulnerable giant Officer Smax; and Girl One, with her impervious, bio-engineered skin. Like their normal TV counterparts, these officers deal with everything--traffic accidents to municipal corruption--that occurs within a continuing, soap-operatic storyline. Moore makes them as human as prime-time cop-show characters, only much more imaginative and exciting, and detailed, finely rendered art helps ground the fantastic goings-on. Lightweight compared to Moore's Jack the Ripper reinterpretation, <i>From Hell</i> (2000), or his reinvention of the superhero in Watchmen series, Top 10 finds Moore simply refreshing the superhero concept and proving--witness Sergeant Caesar--that you can teach an old dog new tricks. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Sales of her books are in the millions, and the list of coveted awards they have garnered - including two Newbery Medals, two National Book Awards, and the Regina Medal - is remarkable.<br>A Sense of Wonder is a collection of more than three dozen critical essays on reading and writing for children that were originally published as two books, Gates of Excellence and The Spying Heart. Combined for the first time in one volume with a new introduction, these writings come from speeches Katherine Paterson has given all over the world, from her book reviews, and from articles she has authored on her craft. Her trademark wit, imagination, and perception are in full evidence; she reveals why she remembers being kissed by Miss Maude Henderson, the last person ever kissed by General Robert E. Lee; relates the heartbreaking source of her novel Bridge to Terabithia; and describes her dismay at failing as a foster parent to two Cambodian boys. Most of all, this extraordinary writer shares her ideas about writing for children, tells of her passion for reading, and allows us to witness her talent. Teachers, writers, students, parents, librarians - anyone who reads Katherine Paterson's essays - will come away with an expanded vision and a sense of her deep respect for words, ideas, literature, and people.</p><p>Katherine Patersonis the renowned author of many classic childrens books, including <em>Bridge to Terabithia</em>; <em>The Great Gilly Hopkins</em>; <em>Lyddie</em>; <em>Jacob Have I Loved</em>; <em>Come Sing, Jimmy Jo</em>; and <em>The Master Puppeteer</em>, among many others.

Back matter offers more information on each plant, as well as on each stage of growth.</p><p>Emily Goodman, a trained horticulturist, has written for many children&#39;s magazines, including Highlights and Apple Seeds. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;Children will look at plants with new eyes after reading this fresh introduction. The plant cycle is introduced, beginning and ending with seeds. After a short description of the many variations of a particular stage, the next page states, "But all these [plants, flowers, fruits, etc.] have a SECRET." Readers are asked if they can identify four key plants (peas, oak trees, tomatoes, roses) at each transition. Using recognizable descriptions, e.g., "round, like plates" or "like balls of fuzz" and getting no more scientific than "pollen," the text will draw readers into the wonder of the topic. Bold color-coded headings introduce each of the four stages. Realistic spot illustrations, beginning with the endpapers, present the variety described in the text. Only the closing endpapers include labels but identification of the other plants, both common and unusual, could be part of the fun. At each transition, the four key plants are framed by the lens of a magnifying glass. End matter includes further detail about each stage and the plant that represents it, e.g., peas for seeds, oak trees for plants, roses for flowers, and tomatoes for fruit. Use this well-designed volume as a the perfect launch to a unit on plants.&#x2014;<i>Carol S.

She has received several writing awards, including the RT Book Reviews Lifetime Achievement Award for Western Romances. Visit her at www.candace-camp.com.Lady Haughston surveyed the throng of people below<p>her, one hand resting lightly on the polished black walnut railing. She was aware that heads turned to look at her. Indeed, she would have been disappointed if they had not.</p><p>Francesca Haughston had been a reigning beauty of the Ton for over a decade now&#x2014;at thirty-three, she no longer cared to be specific about the number of years since her coming out. She had been blessed with a naturally beautiful combination of features&#x2014;light golden hair and large, deep blue eyes, skin that was as smooth and white as cream, a straight, slightly tip-tilted nose, and well-shaped lips that curled up a bit at the ends, giving her a faintly catlike smile. A small mole sat low on her cheek near her mouth, the tiny blemish only accentuating the near-perfection of her features. She was of medium height, with a lithe, slender form and an elegant carriage that made her appear taller than she actually was.</p><p>But even with the natural advantages Francesca had been given, she was always careful to show her looks to the best advantage. One would never find her dressed in anything less than the best, or with a pair of slippers on her feet that did not complement her dress or her hair arranged in a style that did not frame her face becomingly. While always in the forefront of fashion, she was not one to chase after foolish fads but chose only those shades that best suited her coloring and the styles that flattered her shape.</p><p>She was dressed tonight in her signature color of ice blue, the neckline of her satin dress low enough to show off her soft white shoulders and bosom in a way that was just a trifle dashing but not at all vulgar. Silver lace adorned the scoop neckline and ran around the hem of her gown, as well as cascading down the demi-train in back. A simple but striking diamond necklace encircled her slender white throat, a matching bracelet was on one arm, and more single diamonds winked here and there in the intricacies of her hair.</p><p>No one, she was certain, would have guessed that she hadn't a feather to fly with. The truth was that her late, largely unlamented husband Lord Andrew Haughston, an inveterate gambler, had died leaving her with nothing but debts, a fact that she had been at great pains to conceal. No one was aware that the jewels adorning her were paste copies of the actual ones, which she had sold. Nor did even the most hawkeyed Society matron suspect that the kid slippers on her feet had been maintained with the utmost care so that they were now in their third season, or that the dress she wore had been cut from a different gown worn the year before and resewn by her talented maid into a newer style fresh off the most recent fashion doll from France.</p><p>One of the few who knew her true circumstances was the slender, elegant man beside her, Sir Lucien Talbot. He had joined the circle of her admirers during her first season, and though his romantic interest in Francesca was a pleasant fiction in which they both participated, his devotion to her was quite real, for over the course of the years, they had become fast friends.</p><p>Sir Lucien was both stylish and witty, facts that, given his perpetual bachelor status, made him a soughtafter guest at parties. It was well-known that his pockets were frequently to let, as had always been the case with the Talbot family, but that did not mar his reputation as being "of very good Ton," a quality that was held in far higher regard, at least by hostesses. He could always be counted upon to liven the conversation with an acerbic remark or two; he never created a scene; he was an excellent dancer and his stamp of approval could establish a party-giver's reputation.</p><p>"Egad, what a crush," he commented now, raising his quizzing glass to inspect the crowd below them.</p><p>"I believe Lady Welcombe adheres to the notion that a rout must have as many attendees as one has floor space," Francesca agreed lightly. She opened her fan and waved it languidly. "I dread going down there. I know I shall get my toes trampled upon."</p><p>"Ah, but is that not the point of a rout?" A deep voice came from slightly behind her and to her right.</p><p>Francesca knew that voice. "Rochford," she said before she turned her head. "I am surprised to find you here."</p><p>Both Lucien and Francesca turned to face the new arrival, and he sketched a bow to them, replying, "Indeed? I would think that you could reasonably expect to find almost everyone you know here."</p><p>His mouth tightened in that familiar way that was almost, but not quite, a smile. His name was Sinclair, the fifth Duke of Rochford, and if Lucien's presence was sought after by a hostess, the attendance of Rochford was the star in her crown.</p><p>Tall, lean and broad-shouldered, Rochford was dressed in the impeccable black-and-white of formal wear. A discreet ruby nestled in the folds of his snowy cravat and was echoed in the cuff links at his wrists. He was easily the most powerful and aristocratic man in the room at any gathering, and if there were those who did not care for his dark, saturnine good looks, they were rarely heard to say so. His manner, like his dress, was elegant without a hint of showiness, and he was as much admired by men for his excellent horsemanship or his dead aim as he was pursued by women for his fortune, high cheekbones and thickly lashed, Gypsydark eyes. He was approaching forty and had never married, and as a consequence he had become the despair of all but the most determined ladies of the Ton.</p><p>Francesca could not keep from smiling a little at his retort. "Indeed, you are probably correct."</p><p>"You are a vision, as always, Lady Haughston," Rochford told her.</p><p>"A vision?" Francesca arched one delicately curved eyebrow. "I notice you do not say a vision of what. One could suppose almost anything to end that sentence."</p><p>Something glinted in his eyes, but he said in a neutral tone, "No one with eyes to see could suppose that aught but beauty would apply to you."</p><p>"An excellent recovery," Francesca told him. Sir Lucien leaned in toward Francesca, saying in a low voice, "Don't look. Lady Cuttersleigh is approaching."</p><p>But his warning was too late, for a high-pitched woman's voice cut sharply through the air. "Your Grace! What a delight it is to see you."</p><p>A tall, almost skeletally thin woman made her way toward them, her short, rotund husband chugging along in her wake. The daughter of an earl, Lady Cuttersleigh had married a mere baron and was never averse to reminding him and the rest of the world that she had married beneath her. She considered it her duty to marry off her gaggle of daughters to someone worthy of intermingling with her own elevated bloodline. However, given the fact that her daughters strongly resembled her in both face and form, as well as overweening pride, she had found it a difficult proposition. She was one of the stubborn few who had not given up on snaring the Duke of Rochford for one of her girls.</p><p>A pained expression touched Rochford's face briefly before he turned and executed a perfect bow toward the approaching couple. "My lady. Cuttersleigh."</p><p>"Lady Haughston." Lady Cuttersleigh acknowledged Francesca and gave a brief, uninterested nod toward Sir Lucien, whose title fell far below her expectations, before she turned back to Rochford, smiling.</p><p>"Delightful party, is it not? The party of the Season, I vow."</p><p>Rochford said nothing, only giving her a quizzical smile.</p><p>"I wonder how many 'parties of the Season' there will be this year," Sir Lucien commented drily.</p><p>Lady Cuttersleigh favored him with a look of dislike. "There can be only one," she told him repressively.</p><p>"Oh, I should think there will be at least three," Francesca put in. "There is the one with the greatest attendance, which I think this one will surely win. But then there is the party of the year based on how lavishly it is decorated."</p><p>"And the one based on<i> who</i> attends," Sir Lucien added.</p><p>"Well, I know that my Amanda will be sorry that she missed this one," Lady Cuttersleigh said.</p><p>Francesca and Lucien exchanged a glance, and Francesca unfurled her fan and raised it to her face to hide her smile. Whatever the subject, Lady Cuttersleigh could be relied upon to somehow bring her daughters into the conversation.</p><p>Lady Cuttersleigh went on to describe in detail the fever that had laid low two of her daughters and the touching way her eldest, Amanda, had stayed home to watch over them. Francesca could not help but consider what it said about the woman's own maternal instincts that it had been her daughter who had felt the responsibility to remain with the sick girls.</p><p>She continued to babble about the virtues of Amanda until at last Rochford cut in to say, "Yes, my lady, it is clear that your eldest daughter is a saint. Indeed, I imagine that naught but the most virtuous of men would satisfy as a husband for her. May I suggest the Rev. Hubert Paulty? An excellent fellow, and quite suitable for her."</p><p>For once Lady Cuttersleigh was reduced to silence. She gazed at the Duke in consternation, blinking rapidly as she tried to recover from this blow to her efforts. Rochford, however, was too quick for her.</p><p>"Lady Haughston, I believe you promised to introduce me to your esteemed cousin," he went on smoothly, offering Francesca his arm.</p><p>Francesca cast him a laughing glance, but said in a demure voice, "Of course. If you will excuse us, my lady. My lord. Sir Lucien."</p><p>Sir Lucien leaned in close to her, whispering, "Traitor." Francesca could not hold back a small chuckle as she walked away on Rochford's arm. "My esteemed cousin?" she repeated. "Pray, do you mean the one who is far too fond of his port? Or the one who fled to the Continent after a duel?"</p><p>A faint smile curved the Duke's dark features. "I meant, fair lady, anyone of any sort who can get me away from Lady Cuttersleigh."</p><p>Francesca shook her head. "Dreadful woman. She is ensuring her daughters' destinies as spinsters, the way she goes about trying to marry them off. Not only is she horridly ham-handed about pushing them on people, her expectations far exceed the girls' possibilities."</p><p>"You, I understand, ...</p></p><h2>James Joyce&#39;s Odyssey: A Guide to the Dublin of Ulysses</h2><p>Re-creates Joyce&#39;s Dublin of the early twentieth century, comparing it with the modern city, with detailed maps that follow the routes of the principal charachers of &#34;Ulysses&#34; in their travels around Dublin</p><p></p><h2>Offenhauser</h2><p>The fabulous history of Offenhauser, the most successful builder of Indy car racing engines from the mid-30s to the mid-70s.

This 100% pure wool yarn is lighter, warmer, and more water-resistant than yarns from elsewhere, as the long-coated native Icelandic sheep have developed over time to ensure as much protection as possible from the harsh northern climate, giving the wool its special properties.</p><p>With over sixty-five gorgeous designs, there are patterns for a range of garments for the whole family&#x2015;from variations on the traditional Icelandic yoked sweaters to smaller projects such as wooly hats, socks, and scarves, to stunning lacy garments and other more contemporary designs&#x2015;all knit in different weights of Icelandic wool. For all of the patterns complete step-by-step instructions are paired with easy-to-follow lace and color knitting charts, and all the stitches, techniques, and abbreviations you need&#x2015;including how to work two-color knitting&#x2015;and more are in the back.</p><p>Beautifully photographed in Iceland and created in collaboration with Iceland's largest wool manufacturer, ï¿½stex, the book includes a brief history on the emergence of the Icelandic Lopi sweater and the Icelandic wool industry.</p></p><p><p>VEDIS JONSDOTTIR grew up on a farm on the west coast of Iceland. She has worked as a knitwear designer for many companies in Iceland before she started designing handknits and became head designer at ï¿½stex. She has revitalized Icelandic handknits by introducing new shapes and more intricate color combinations. Vï¿½dï¿½s also chooses the yarn colors for ï¿½stex, seeking inspiration in Icelandic nature, to bring out the best qualities of the wool. She currently lives in Manhattan.</p><p>&#x201c;The combination of knitting history, attractive patterns, and in-depth information about Icelandic knitting traditions and techniques make this an excellent addition to knitting collections.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal starred review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Truly an inspiring book.... The sport-to-chunky sweaters all incorporate beautiful colorwork motifs, many easy enough for a beginning two-color knitter. Patterns for the smallest to tallest all look delightful. Vedis Jonsdottir has created a compelling book from every angle. Let's go get some Lopi!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Knit Circus</i></p><p>&#x201c;In general, the photography is wonderful, the patterns are beautiful, and the instructions are written clearly. The book is a hardcover, and feels and looks like a classic that you will return to time and again for wardrobe staples.... I recommend this book for knitters who like the classic Icelandic sweater look, who enjoy (or who want to venture into) stranded colorwork, and for those looking for a pattern book that will outlast the latest trends in knitwear.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Underground Crafter blog</i></p></p><h2>Christie&#39;s pictorial history of Chinese ceramics</h2><p>319 pages.

Yet <i>Better Homes &amp; Gardens</i> contributing editor Suzy Bales lures us to the windows, the garden paths, and outdoor areas to witness the beauty and vitality of the winter garden. <br><br>The possibilities for creating interest in the winter landscape are considerable. Through Suzy's eyes, you'll discover the intriguing patterns of tree bark; the sculptural shapes created by trees, arching vines, shrubs, and seedheads of perennials and grasses; the outline of outdoor structures, containers, and ornaments; and the unexpected but welcome dashes of color added by conifers, berries, early bulbs, and yes, even flowers.

Described as both a memoir and &#39;a book of superb stories&#39; by Ali Smith, her startlingly evocative prose offers a glimpse of the mysteries of winter ice, the bonhomie of balalaika parties, and the vastness of Christmas viewed from beneath the tree. This deluxe hardback, with rare images from the Jansson family archive, makes a perfect gift.</p><p><p>Tove Jansson's memoirs of her early years, filled with joy, exuberance, and the satisfaction of being alive</p><p>The excitement of being alive and savoring the good things in life pervades the writing of Tove Jansson. The beloved nine volumes of her Moomintroll chronicles for younger readers, her two adult novels, <em>The Summer Book</em> and <em>Sun City</em>, and her internationally known paintings and drawings reveal this delight. In these memoirs of her very early years, richly illustrated with personal photographs, Jansson shares the pleasures of experiencing nature in Finland and growing up with a happy, freedom-loving family. It is an account of childhood that speaks to readers everywhere.</p>Tove Jansson (1914-2001) is best known as the creator of the much loved Moomin stories for children. However, in her fifties she turned her attention to writing for adults, producing a dozen novels and story collections. Sculptor&#39;s Daughter was the first, in 1968, followed by The Listener, three years later, which will be published by June 2014 [9781908745361].</p><h2>Labyrinth: The Storybook Based on the Movie</h2><p>Sarah&#39;s thoughtless remark that she wished the goblins would take her little brother lead her and the boy into the dangerous world of the goblin king.</p><p>Grade 2-5 Sarah has trouble coming to terms with the arrival of her new half-brother, Toby. One evening while babysitting, a frustrated Sarah says, "I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now!" Unknowingly, Sarah has uttered just the right words, and the goblins, accompanied by their king, appear in the nursery and whisk away the infant. Sarah finds herself lost in a Labyrinth with only 13 hours to discover the secret to the maze and rescue her brother before he becomes a goblin forever. Sarah has many trials, meets several unusual creatures, and must solve many puzzles but ultimately reaches the center of the Labyrinth and, through the power of love, destroys the goblin king and returns her brother to their home. As often happens when a book is based on a motion picture, the print version suffers terribly. Many readers will have already seen the movie and will find that the book lacks the suspense that special effects add. The extraordinary creatures mentioned in the text, while faithfully rendered by McNally based on Jim Hensen's creations, are never fully explained or developed, and the heroine predictably saves the day. This would be a trendyand superfluousaddition to library collections. Pamela T.

In the breaking, shimmering dawn, the sleek, matte-black American submarine strained on the surface at full speed, 18 knots, her powerful diesel engines leaving a boiling wake astern. Wahoo was approaching the Vitiaz Strait, a narrow waterway separating the Solomon Sea from the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of the big island of New Guinea. The strait was a maritime chokepoint, patrolled by Japanese aircraft and anti-submarine vessels from nearby New Britain Island&#x2014;dangerous water for U.S. submarines.<br><br> Wahoo&#x2019;s seventy-one crewmembers shared an edgy expectancy. They were embarked on a war patrol to seek out armed, enemy ships. They would be risking all. Thousands of miles from a friendly port, they would face the enemy alone. Defeat would mean death in their own iron coffin, in a nameless deep. They were heading into a no man&#x2019;s sea, and Wahoo was fair game for foe, or even friend&#x2014;patrol planes from Australia had a nasty habit of dropping bombs on American submarines. Normal doctrine called for Wahoo to dive beneath the surface at first light and proceed submerged. But the situation was not normal. Wahoo was holding to a breakneck pace to reach a Japanese-occupied harbor, and running on the surface would save precious hours.<br><br> Now, seven days out of the U.S. Submarine Base at Brisbane, Australia, Wahoo was several hours ahead of schedule heading for her patrol area around the Japanese-held Palau Islands east of the Philippines. En route to her assigned area, Wahoo had orders to make a slight detour, if possible, to reconnoiter the anchorage of Wewak on the north coast of New Guinea, captured by the Japanese in the conquest of the East Indies the year before. It was used by the Japanese as a staging area to support amphibious operations in the Solomon Islands chain. Thanks to her four powerful diesel engines Wahoo was able to maintain an 18-knot speed, almost 21 statute miles per hour. (A knot, a nautical mile per hour, is 1.15 statute miles an hour.) To fit in the requested reconnaissance, Wahoo was running at full speed on the surface despite the proximity of Japanese airfields. Submerged on batteries, her speed would have been reduced to 5 or 6 knots at best.<br><br> Though crewmembers were apprehensive, they were curiously confident. For Wahoo on her third war patrol was commanded by two officers whom they trusted, and whose leadership was soon to become famous throughout the U.S. Submarine Force. The sense of confidence was pointedly shared by the executive officer, Lieutenant Richard O&#x2019;Kane, a handsome 31-year-old sailor with light-brown almost rusty hair, a strong jaw, firm set to his mouth, and an open face. Dick O&#x2019;Kane was of medium height and in fine physical condition. A New England Yankee, O&#x2019;Kane was energetic and outgoing, but sometimes sharp-tongued. His temperament was changeable, the crew thought. He could be voluble, or he could be quiet. The XO seemed by turns charming or curt, warm or irascible. But whatever his mood, he had a reputation as a hard-charger.<br><br> O&#x2019;Kane put Wahoo into commission on June 15, 1942, as executive officer under then skipper, Commander Marvin Kennedy. O&#x2019;Kane was delighted with the vessel&#x2019;s name. U.S. fleet boats were named after marine life and a wahoo is a large, swift, game fish. But &#x201c;Wahoo&#x201d; sounded to O&#x2019;Kane and the crew like the name of an Indian tribe. So her battle flag pictured an American Indian headdress.<br><br> Despite Wahoo&#x2019;s early promise and well-trained crew, O&#x2019;Kane, the number two, was frustrated at Captain Kennedy&#x2019;s performance as skipper on the first two Pacific war patrols. He believed Kennedy was not aggressive enough, and failed to press attacks against choice enemy targets, including an aircraft carrier. Dick O&#x2019;Kane decided he would not make a third war patrol under Marvin Kennedy. He would ask for a transfer off Wahoo.<br><br> O&#x2019;Kane&#x2019;s unstated feelings were shared by the enlisted men and other officers, and that mood translated into ragged morale among the crewmen, who were all volunteers prepared to risk their lives on patrol. Wahoo, with only one confirmed enemy ship sunk, had not made much of a record. Captain Kennedy may have had his excuses, but the crew did not want excuses. They wanted a good record. They wanted to sink enemy ships.<br><br> What buoyed the morale of Dick O&#x2019;Kane and Wahoo&#x2019;s men was the presence of a dynamic new skipper, Lieutenant Commander Dudley W. Morton, thirty-five, a tall, dark-haired, broad-shouldered athlete, with ham-hands, a friendly smile, and an approachable manner. Morton exuded confidence and ability. He was familiar with the crew, having made the second war patrol aboard Wahoo as the Prospective Commanding Officer&#x2014;the PCO, or &#x201c;makee-learn&#x201d; in sub slang.<br><br> Kentucky-born and Florida-raised, Morton acquired his nickname, Mush, short for &#x201c;Mushmouth,&#x201d; at the Naval Academy because of his heavy Southern drawl. Mush Morton liked roaming the boat chatting with the sailors. Wahoo&#x2019;s engineer, Lieutenant George Grider, thought Mush was built like a bear and playful as a cub.<br><br> Dick O&#x2019;Kane was familiar with Mush Morton&#x2019;s record. Morton was a varsity football player and wrestler who had been in command of the ancient submarine R-5 in the Atlantic. Mush had vainly fired two torpedoes at what he thought was a German U-boat. Transferred to the Pacific as a Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO), Morton was assigned to the venerable Dolphin as relief crew skipper. He looked the boat over, took her out on a training exercise off Pearl Harbor, and decided the sub was too creaky and should be retired&#x2014;or assigned solely to training duties. &#x201c;Dolphin is a death trap,&#x201d; Morton told the executive officer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to try to get off her. I advise you to do the same.&#x201d;<br><br> This high-handed attitude, which branded Morton a maverick in the eyes of some squadron commanders, resulted in his removal from command of Dolphin. He was on the verge of being &#x201c;surfaced&#x201d; out of submarines to regular duty when he was rescued by a senior staffer, Captain John H. &#x201c;Babe&#x201d; Brown, also an Academy football player. Brown kept Morton in the PCO pool at Pearl Harbor. He was assigned as a PCO passenger aboard Wahoo for the second war patrol, which left Pearl Harbor traveling through the South Pacific to Brisbane. Mush Morton was determined to vindicate himself and Babe Brown&#x2019;s confidence in him.<br><br> During Wahoo&#x2019;s second patrol, Morton shared O&#x2019;Kane&#x2019;s view that Captain Kennedy was far too cautious. The higher authorities in Brisbane concurred, and on the last day of 1942, Mush Morton was given command of Wahoo.<br><br> Dick O&#x2019;Kane was impressed by Mush Morton&#x2019;s first action on taking control. Calling the crew together, Mush said quietly, &#x201c;I am glad to have everyone of you aboard Wahoo personally. What I have to say can be stated simply. Wahoo is expendable. We will take every reasonable precaution, but our mission is to sink enemy shipping. We are going out there on this war patrol to search for Japs. Every smoke trace on the horizon, every contact on watch will be investigated. If it turns out to be the enemy, we are going to hunt him down and kill him.&#x201d;<br><br> Morton paused. &#x201c;Now if anyone doesn&#x2019;t want to go along under these conditions, just see the yeoman. I am giving him verbal authority to transfer anyone who is not a volunteer. Nothing will ever be said about your remaining in Brisbane.&#x201d;<br><br> A half-hour later, just before sailing time, Morton checked with Yeoman Second Class Forest J. Sterling, the ship&#x2019;s clerk.<br><br> &#x201c;Any customers, Yeo?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a one, Captain.&#x201d;<br><br> Morton grinned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the kind of stuff I like in a crew.&#x201d;<br><br> Now, sailing into combat, Wahoo had a captain and an executive officer who seemed to form a command team infused with fighting spirit, which radiated a mood of cockiness and assurance. Mush Morton clearly placed full trust in Dick O&#x2019;Kane, and the exec repaid his skipper&#x2019;s faith with loyalty and expertise.<br><br> Dick O&#x2019;Kane was eager to fight. At the U.S. Sub Base in Brisbane a few days earlier, he learned that his first submarine, the elderly USS Argonaut, had been reported overdue and presumed lost&#x2014;after a depth charging by a Japanese destroyer in waters near New Britain, not far from the Wahoo&#x2019;s present transit area. What better way to avenge this personal loss, O&#x2019;Kane thought, than by using the training he gained from Argonaut to help Wahoo score against the enemy? After three war patrols, O&#x2019;Kane knew that submariners liked being on a boat with a good combat record. They wanted skippers and execs who could conduct a war patrol that would make them proud.<br><br> As for the crew&#x2019;s view, Yeoman Sterling sensed Wahoo was different this time out, with a strong spirit growing in her. There was more of a feeling of freedom, of camaraderie, Sterling thought, of men being trusted to get their jobs done. The ship was no longer uptight but relaxed, though still taut and alert. The yeoman thought that Wahoo would make her own luck.<br><br> Heading for Wewak, Mush Morton posted additional lookouts at the bridge&#x2014;rather than submerging at a much-reduced speed. Daylight surface running was a new innovation, since U.S. subs usually spent the day submerged when they were anywhere near enemy air searches. Morton&#x2019;s bold tactic did not sit well with everyone. Some Wahoo junior officers, going into battle under the aggressive new skipper, had qualms&#x2014;and wondered whether their skipper wasn&#x2019;t taking too many chances. George Grider, a tall, thoughtful pipe-smoker from Memphis, Tennessee, believed some of Mush Morton&#x2019;s bolder comments during Wahoo&#x2019;s second patrol reflected the absence of a reasonable degree of caution. Running on the surface in daylight near Japanese airfields seemed to Grider to be rash, if invigorating. With Captain Morton on the bridge, Grider was Officer of the Deck (OOD) when the lookouts spotted a plane in the far distance. Grider prepared to scramble down the bridge hatch for the expected crash dive.<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wait till he gets in to six miles,&#x201d; Mush Morton said quietly.<br><br> &#x201c;Great Lord,&#x201d; Grider thought, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re under the command of a madman.&#x201d; The enemy plane closed to 61/2 miles and then veered away. By not diving, Morton saved hours. The tactic had worked, Grider grudgingly admitted, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure he was in favor of it.<br><br> Entering Vitiaz Strait, from Wahoo&#x2019;s flying bridge Captain Morton watched the skies for Japanese planes. A lookout reported a Mitsubishi bomber that had sneaked in four miles away.<br><br> &#x201c;Clear the bridge,&#x201d; Morton ordered. &#x201c;Dive! Dive!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;ahoogah, ahoogah.&#x201d; Two raucous blasts sounded from the diving klaxon. Lookouts tumbled below through the bridge hatch to the conning tower, followed by Grider and Morton, who ordered, &#x201c;Take her down.&#x201d; The bridge hatch clanged shut. The Quartermaster dogged it down.<br><br> &#x201c;Green board,&#x201d; reported Chief of the Boat, Russell &#x201c;Pappy&#x201d; Rau at the &#x201c;Christmas tree&#x201d; control board. &#x201c;Pressure in the boat.&#x201d;<br><br> Wahoo slipped quickly beneath the surface. The main air induction valve had slammed shut with a wheeze. Water gurgled into the ballast tanks as air hissed and sputtered out. Throbbing diesels abruptly stopped as the ship shifted to battery-powered, electric drive to run smoothly under water. Wahoo was closing Wewak and Morton decided to run submerged the rest of the day.<br><br> In the control room, the officers discussed tactics. George Grider suggested that the instruction &#x201c;reconnoiter&#x201d; meant to take a periscope look outside Wewak harbor, and simply note the shipping activity.<br><br> Captain Morton countered, &#x201c;No, boy, the only way you can reconnoiter a harbor is to go right into it and see what&#x2019;s there.&#x201d; With that, George Grider glanced in consternation at fellow officers&#x2014;Roger Paine Jr., lean, dark-haired with a ready smile who ran the torpedo data computer; and Richie Henderson, tall, thin, and serious. It was clear, Grider decided, that the captain had advanced from rashness to outright foolhardiness. It would be crazy for Wahoo to submerge and enter an enemy harbor whose very location on the map they couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint.</p><h2>Squirrels Busy Year A Science Storybook</h2><p>Its winter.

Now, in what is both a companion volume and an independent study, he traces the component elements that make up different types of cities: streets, public places, urban divisions (religious, political, and social), and the fringe area where city and countryside meet.<br>In every instance, Professor Kostof follows a story that ranges widely in time and place up to the present to indicate that the discussion remains fresh and engages our own time in unexpected ways. In the past, all the elements of a city evolved in response to a variety of pressures. Today they are usually the result of planning decisions. In a final chapter, Kostof considers "urban process" - the effect on cities of natural disasters, war, and comprehensive redevelopment, compared with incremental growth and change. His book is thus an exercise in architectural and social history, a case study for the present, and a pointer for the future. Urban form is never innocent of social content: it is merely the matrix within which we organize daily life, and we have strong opinions about it. Modernism was a harsh intrusion in the development of almost every theme. The current recovery from the less tolerant aspects of that doctrine has made us look again at what it is that we treasure in the traditional city, and how we can recharge the old urban forms with present-day common sense.<br>The story is also told in over three hundred drawings, prints, paintings, and photographs that trace not only patterns but uses, from the colonnaded street of ancient Palmyra to the recent demonstrations in Prague's Wenceslas Square.</p><p><b>Spiro Kostof</b> (1936-1991) was Professor of Architectural History at the University of California at Berkley, and also taught at Yale, Columbia, MIT, and Rice universities.This final book by noted architectural historian Kostof, who died in 1991, is a companion to The City Shaped ( LJ 10/1/91; LJ's Best Books of 1991, LJ 1/92, p. 56). Here he considers the parts that make up the city through time--walls, urban divisions, public places, the street, and the urban process. The book is wide-ranging in time and space and presents the fruits of a lifetime of looking, but it is fragmented, appearing to be almost an assembly of notes for a more considered work or for The City Shaped. Still, the author is an astute observer, and his remarks are frequently illuminating for specialists and novices alike. This survey of the microparts of cities will be of interest primarily to professionals and historians but also to urban inhabitants, the same audience addressed by William Whyte ( City: Rediscovering Its Center , LJ 2/1/89).<br><i>- Jack Perry Brown, Art Inst. of Chicago Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p>
